PREFACE.


During several years spent in collecting zoölogical specimens in the
Philippine Islands the author has constantly experienced the need of a
book containing descriptions of the Philippine birds. That others have
felt the same want is evident from the many requests for literature
received. Lists of Philippine birds [1] have been published from time
to time but they contain no descriptions and are of use to those only
who have a considerable library at hand.

The Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum contains descriptions of
most of the known species of birds and these include very many of the
Philippine species but the bulk of its 27 volumes would preclude the
use of this work in the field even if its rarity and cost were not
prohibitory. Thus there is an almost total lack of adequate means
for identifying Philippine birds which has been a serious check to
activity and interest in ornithological work throughout the Islands.

To meet this need and to place descriptions of the birds inhabiting
the Philippines in a convenient form for the use of local naturalists
the present work has been prepared. Technical terms and references
to internal structure have been avoided as far as possible although
this method weakens, to some extent, the keys and diagnoses of the
higher groups. The diagnoses of orders, families, and genera being
drawn from Philippine species may or may not define these groups as
represented outside of the Archipelago.

The actual material which has been available for study consists of
about 8,000 specimens of birds collected for the Bureau of Science,
a few skins received in exchange from the Menage Collection, nearly
200 skins received from the United States National Museum, part
in exchange and part as a loan, and a few small lots of skins from
various sources. There are, however, some 150 species inhabiting the
Philippines of which not a single specimen has been examined. Of some
other species the available material is quite inadequate for complete
descriptions; this is particularly true of the shore and water birds,
most of which visit the Philippine Islands as migrants and can not
be obtained here in breeding plumage.

To meet these deficiencies a large number of descriptions have been
taken from previous works, notably the Catalogue of Birds in the
British Museum, Oates's Birds of British Burmah, and the four volumes
on birds in the Fauna of British India, while a few have been taken
from periodicals. All copied descriptions and parts of descriptions
are inclosed in quotation marks followed by the authors' names;
the exact reference in each case will be found in the synonymy of
the species described.

The quotations ending with "Bourns and Worcester MS." are taken from a
manuscript prepared by Messrs. Frank S. Bourns and Dean C. Worcester
and based upon the ornithological specimens collected by the Menage
Expedition. This manuscript was intended for publication by the
Minnesota Academy of Natural Sciences, but as that institution was
unable to meet the necessary expense, the right to use the manuscript
reverted to the authors who have permitted the publication of their
notes in this Manual.

The scientific name, an English name, and such native names as seem
to be commonly used with some degree of accuracy are given for each
species.

The synonymy consists of references to original descriptions and
to all works from which quotations are made; also to the following
works when the species is given in them: Catalogue of Birds in
the British Museum, Sharpe's Hand-List of the Genera and Species
of Birds, Oates and Reid's Catalogue of Birds' Eggs in the British
Museum, and McGregor and Worcester's Hand-List of Philippine Birds;
other references are to plates or figures, records of rare species,
important descriptions, notes on habits, or critical remarks. [2]

The distribution of each species is given by islands, arranged
alphabetically, with the names of collectors so far as these have
been worked out from the available literature. Distribution outside
of the Philippine Islands is given in a general way only.

To the descriptions and measurements of the birds are added notes
on habits, nests and eggs, abundance, etc. and in very many cases
manuscript notes by Bourns and Worcester, giving information on habits,
colors of soft parts, measurements, and validity of species.

All measurements are in the metric system. In copied descriptions
inches and hundredths have been carefully reduced to millimeters and
the English measurements omitted, tenths and hundredths of millimeters
being disregarded in most instances.

In accordance with Canon XXXVII of the Code of Nomenclature adopted
by the American Ornithologists' Union, Revised Edition (1908), generic
and specific names, unless evidently misprinted, are spelled as in the
original descriptions. Dr. Charles W. Richmond, Assistant Curator,
Division of Birds, United States National Museum, has most kindly
verified a very large number of these citations.

The last half century has been exceedingly fruitful in systems of
classification, some of them excellent, most of them suggestive and
helpful. The whole subject has been reviewed in a masterly way by
Newton, Dictionary of Birds, London (1896), 45-120 of introduction.

The present author has not the ability to judge of the relative merits
of the schemes of classification proposed by various authors but the
system set forth in Sharpe's Hand-List [3] and copied in McGregor
and Worcester's Hand-List of Philippine Birds is followed as being
both convenient and well known.







USE OF THE KEYS.


A key is a short cut used to approximate identification without
reading a great number of descriptions. The keys given here differ in
no essential particular from those to be found in other systematic
works on ornithology, but for the benefit of the beginner their use
may be briefly explained.

Having in hand an unknown bird begin with the key to the Orders
(p. 7), reading first the line beginning a1; if the specimen has
the characters given after a1 then the bird belongs to the Order
Pelecaniformes and another key is to be used which will be found
under that order, (p. 200). If the characters on the line after
a1 are not found in the specimen, then those given on the line a2
are to be examined and these the specimen must have, if no mistake
has been made. The next choice is between b1 and b2 and so on until
characters are found which agree with those of the specimen and at
the same time lead to a word at the right printed in heavy face type;
this is the name of the order to which the specimen belongs.

Having determined the order turn to the page where the order begins
and use the key there which leads to the suborders or to the families,
then find and use the keys to genera and species.

To illustrate the use of keys with a concrete example, suppose that we
have a specimen of the common spoon-billed duck or shoveler, but know
nothing of its affinities. Beginning with the key to orders we find:

"a1. Hind toe connected by a web to the inner toe." As this does not
agree with our specimen we try:


"a2. Hind toe not connected by a web to the inner toe." Yes.

  "b1. Nostrils tubular." No.
  "b2. Nostrils not tubular." Yes.

    "c1. Cutting edges of bill more or less distinctly fringed or
    serrated, tip of bill rounded ... Anseriformes."


Yes, and our bird belongs in the order Anseriformes. By a similar
procedure we find that our duck belongs in the subfamily Anatinæ
(p. 185) and in the key to genera (p. 187) we find:


"a1. Bill not spatulate."
"a2. Bill flattened, and spatulate ... Spatula."


As our duck has a flattened, spatulate bill we turn to the genus
Spatula (p. 196) and as there is but one Philippine species in this
genus we know that our bird is--


Spatula clypeata (Linnæus).

Order GALLIFORMES.

MEGAPODES, PAINTED QUAIL, AND PHEASANTS.

Bill short and stout, culmen curved; head small; body heavy; wings
short and rounded, curved to the body; tail either very short or
greatly elongated; legs moderate to heavy; claws well developed; toes
four, slightly webbed at base. Members of this order are terrestrial;
their flight is strong and swift but can not be sustained for a long
distance. Their food consists of grain, seeds, and insects. The nest
is usually a slight hollow in the ground, hidden by grass or brush;
the megapodes, however, bury their eggs in mounds.

Adult.--Top of head dark blue-gray with a wash of olive-brown; a narrow
gray collar on hind neck; rest of upper parts, including exposed parts
of folded wing, rich olive-brown; lower parts dark blue-gray. Iris
brown; bill yellow, dusky at base and about nostrils; legs and nails
black or dark brown; skin about eye varies from bright red to almost
black. A male from Cagayancillo measures, 340 in length; wing, 230;
tail, 72.4; tarsus, 62; middle toe with claw, 57; bill from nostril,
14. A female from the same island measures, 340 in length; wing, 235;
tail, 70; tarsus, 58; middle toe with claw, 57; bill from nostril, 14.

Young.--A bird measuring but 165 in length, taken in Calayan, October
7, 1903, bears a general resemblance to the adult but the superorbital
space, lores, chin, and throat are closely feathered; forehead, chin,
and area below eye dull yellowish brown; throat, sides of neck, and
breast dull brown; middle of abdomen dark ochraceous brown; feathers
of upper parts dark brown, obscurely edged with olive-brown on back,
scapulars, and wing-coverts; plumage, except remiges and rectrices,
soft and decomposed.

Nest.--The incubation mound built by this species is fully described
below. The eggs are prized by the natives for food; both the eggs and
the birds are quite palatable. When fresh the thin surface layer of the
egg is dark pink, usually smooth, but occasionally roughened by small
lumps; when exposed to air and light for some time the color becomes
dull, dirty brown and in many cases the outer layer crumbles away
exposing the true shell which is dull white and closely pitted. Five
eggs from Calayan taken in December measure: 78 by 52; 82 by 52.5;
82.5 by 47; 80 by 51; 79 by 51.

"This species probably occurs on every island of any size in the
group. It is frequently met with a considerable distance inland,
where it frequents wooded plains and hill. Its nest is usually,
though by no means always, built near the seashore. Several pairs
of birds frequently nest in the same mound, scratching up a little
additional material every time that an egg is deposited, eventually
forming a very large mound of earth, decayed leaves, sticks, etc.,
which in extreme cases comes to measure from 4 to 5 meters in diameter
by 1 1/2 meters high in the middle. The mound is frequently formed
about the roots of some old stump. When ready to lay, the female
tunnels into this mound, sometimes even burrowing into the solid
ground to a depth of half a meter or more, so that the eggs are one
to two meters below the surface of the mound. The egg is deposited at
the bottom of this burrow, which is then filled up. The young birds
dig to the surface as soon as hatched. They can run and fly when
they leave the shell, and seem always to shift for themselves from
the day of their birth. M. cumingi seems to lay all the year round,
the female apparently depositing an egg about once a week. The eggs
are oval in form, of a curious pinkish color when fresh, but rapidly
fading to a light dirty brown if exposed to the light.

"The old birds seem rather reluctant to take wing and when flushed fly
but a short distance, alight on the ground and run with great rapidity.

"There is much individual variation as to size and color even in birds
from one locality. Length, 336 to 380; culmen, 15 to 19; tarsus, 55
to 68; wing, 210 to 233; tail, 63 to 86. Iris dark chocolate-brown;
bill light yellowish at tip, brown at base; legs sometimes dark brown,
but usually strongly tinged with red, especially at back; feet dark
brown to black; nails black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Adult male.--Upper parts dark brown; most of the feathers with light
shaft-lines, large subterminal black blotches, and some black bars; the
black markings heaviest on lower back; forehead, circumorbital area,
sides of neck, breast, and flanks slate-blue; chin, upper throat,
and lower half of face black; throat patch bordered posteriorly by
a wide, crescentic, white patch which is bordered posteriorly by
a narrow black band; a white included patch on side of face from
lower mandible to below ear, the anterior end of which is pointed;
a narrow white line from below nostril to eye; a patch of rich
chestnut covering middle of abdomen and lower breast; wings sandy
brown; coverts and secondaries vermiculated with darker brown; tail
chestnut; upper tail-coverts chestnut mixed with slate-blue. Iris
deep red; bill dark blue, black along upper part; legs dark yellow;
nails brown. Length about 135. Five males measure: Wing, 66 to 70;
tail-coverts, [4] 26 to 28; exposed culmen, 9 to 11; tarsus, 18 to 19.

Adult female.--Upper parts and wings as in the male, but with a light
buff, median line on head; forehead, sides of head, and throat dark
buff; the black and white throat patch of male replaced in female by
an equal area of dark buff in which the white bases of feathers show
through on chin and upper throat; a line of fine black spots from
gape to below ear-coverts; breast and flanks light buff, each feather
crossed by one to three crescentic marks of blackish brown; middle of
abdomen white or with a pale buff wash. Five females measure: Wing,
67 to 71; tail-coverts, 22 to 26; exposed culmen, 10 to 11; tarsus,
17 to 18.5.

Young.--In a very young chick from Sibuyan, sex undetermined, the
upper parts, including wings and coverts, are blackish brown; top of
head marked with three buffy lines extending from forehead to nape
and separated by wide blackish brown bands; wing-coverts and feathers
of back with edges and shafts buff; chin and throat pale yellow;
upper breast, sides, and flanks black with wide white shaft-stripes;
belly dirty yellowish buff. A nearly full grown male in mixed plumage,
from Calapan, has the black chin-spot developed, the white patches
partly developed, and the breast, abdomen, and flanks retain some
of the old striped feathers of the first plumage along with the new
chestnut and slate feathers. The young female of E. chinensis is said
to have the upper breast and sides spotted; as age increases these
spots resolve themselves into transverse bars. The young female of
E. lineata probably undergoes a similar change of plumage.

Both the painted and bustard quails frequent grassy fields and
plains, usually in small companies. When flushed they fly but a
short distance and seldom get up a second time, seeming to place more
reliance on running than on flight. Except Polyplectron the genera
of the Philippine Turnicidæ and Phasianidæ range from the coasts to
the highlands.



Genus GALLUS Brisson, 1760.

Head surmounted by a fleshy comb; a wattle on each side of throat;
tail laterally compressed, the central feathers being higher than the
lateral ones; the former greatly elongated and curved in the males;
feathers of neck and rump long and pointed; each tarsus armed with
a long sharp spur.

Adult male.--Sides of head, chin, and throat clothed with scattered
hair-like feathers; ear protected by short close-set feathers;
feathers on top of head, neck, and mantle lanceolate, those of
mantle very long; head, neck, and sides of neck dark reddish brown,
becoming lighter and yellowish near ends of longest feathers, and
forming a zone of orange-yellow, the tips again darker, reddish, and
shaft-lines darker; mantle feathers hidden by hackles, and lesser
coverts blackish brown with slight gloss; lower back and median
coverts rich maroon-red forming a wide crescent; lanceolate rump
feathers dark orange-red; below (except a few lanceolate reddish
feathers on throat) blackish brown with a slight green gloss not
always evident; primaries dark brown edged with buff; secondaries
dark brown with exposed outer webs dark cinnamon, mottled near tips;
alula and greater coverts blackish brown, the latter with green and
purple gloss; tail and its upper coverts black, glossed with green;
middle pair of rectrices curved outward and about twice the length
of next pair. Top of head decorated with a deeply emarginated, fleshy
comb, crimson in color; a wattle on each side of throat also crimson;
a round lappet below each ear light bluish; other bare areas of head
and neck pale crimson; bill dark brown above, lighter below; legs gray,
spurs black, nails dark brown. The length varies greatly, of course,
with the development of central rectrices. A male from Mariveles,
Bataan measures, 660 in length; wing, flat on rule, 235; tail, 368;
bill from front of comb, 17; tarsus, 74; middle toe with claw, 59;
spur, 24. A male from Fuga, tail, 508; spur, 28.

"Adult female.--Top of the head rust-red, shading into orange on the
neck and pale yellow on the upper mantle, each feather with a wide
black stripe down the center; rest of upper parts pale reddish brown,
finely mottled with black and with pale shafts; quills blackish brown,
the outer half of the outer webs of secondaries mottled with pale
reddish brown; fore part of neck chestnut; chest and breast pale light
red, shading into pale reddish brown on sides, flanks, and belly,
each feather with a pale shaft; under tail-coverts brownish black;
tail-feathers like the secondaries, the center pair of feathers mottled
on the margins of both webs, and the outer pairs on the outer web,
with pale rufous. Soft parts much the same as those of the male;
comb very much smaller, and wattles absent. Length, 420; wing, 190;
tail, 140; tarsus, 61.

"Immature males have the hackles of the mantle much paler than in
the majority of adult birds and mostly with dark shaft-stripes; the
chestnut part of the outer webs of the secondaries finely mottled
with black nearly to the margins; the feathers underlying the hackles
of the mantle dull, brownish black without any green gloss, and the
comb and wattles rudimentary." (Grant.)

Chick.--Below light yellow-buff, palest on chin; throat, upper breast,
and sides of neck washed with brownish buff; top and sides of head
dark yellow-buff; a band from above angle of mouth backward through
eye to side of neck dark cinnamon, bordered above with blackish brown;
middle of crown and hind neck with a wide, black-bordered cinnamon
patch which becomes diffused on interscapular region, reappears on
middle of back and is continued to the tail; the black bordered on
each side with light buff followed by dark brown; wings and tail light
brown, speckled and vermiculated with darker brown. Iris light brown;
bill, legs, and nails flesh. Small chicks were taken in Mariveles,
Province of Bataan, March 8, 1902, and at Irisan, Province of Benguet,
on April 30, 1903.

Nest.--A slight hollow dug in the earth in the shelter of bushes or
grass is the usual nest. The eggs are much smaller than with domestic
varieties; four from a nest found February 26, 1904, near Mariveles,
Bataan, measure respectively: 47 by 36; 44 by 34; 45 by 35; 46 by
35. In color the eggs are light creamy buff; the shape is similar to
that found in eggs from the domestic varieties.

The jungle fowl is found throughout the Philippines and the males are
frequently domesticated by the natives and used for their national
pastime of cock fighting. In this country at least the wild chickens
afford the gunner no sport whatever as they habitually remain within
thick tangles of brush where wing-shots are impossible, or, if by
chance caught in the open, they scurry to the nearest thicket. There
is no great difficulty, however, in securing specimens, if one cares
to kill them sitting. Their flesh is usually tender and more savory
than that of the domestic birds. The male has a high falsetto voice
resembling very much that of a young domestic cock. Delighting in
small growth mixed with a tangle of bamboo and rattan, especially if
near cultivated fields, this species generally avoids true forest
unless there be near-by clearings. The natives are very successful
in taking the cocks alive by employing a live decoy which they picket
within a small corral of snares.



Genus POLYPLECTRON Temminck, 1807.

Bill similar to that of Gallus; feathers of crown forming a long
crest; wings short and rounded; rectrices twenty-four in number and
greatly graduated; upper tail-coverts lengthened; tarsi covered with
transverse plates and each tarsus armed with two or three sharp spurs;
tarsus longer than middle toe with claw.

    Pavo real, Spanish name.

    Palawan (Everett, Whitehead, Platen, Bourns & Worcester, White).


Adult male.--Black; top of head, crest, and hind neck green, changing
with the light to purple; a large white patch from base of lower
mandible extending over ear-coverts; a narrow superciliary line
of white (this line is absent in some specimens; in others wider
and confluent on nape); mantle, secondaries, and greater and median
wing-coverts green, changing to blue and purple, bases of the feathers
black; remainder of wing brown or blackish; back and rump black,
thickly marked with small, rusty buff spots; longest coverts and
rectrices similar but the spots fewer and lighter and each feather
with two large, round or oval spots of peacock-green, surrounded by
a black ring and an outer gray ring; longest coverts tipped with
a narrow line of pale buff; rectrices tipped with lines of black,
gray, white, and gray, the white line narrow and sharply defined;
under parts all black, except tail-coverts which are speckled with
buff. "Bill black tipped with pale horn-color; eyes chocolate-brown;
legs, feet, and nails brown." (Bourns and Worcester.) A male from
Iwahig, Palawan, measures: Wing, 190; tail, 240; exposed culmen, 28;
bill from nostril, 15; tarsus, 66; middle toe with claw, 56.

Female.--Top of head and a short crest dark brown; sides of face, chin,
and throat white; remainder of the plumage brown, more rusty above
and on wings, finely speckled with dark brown and black; tail with
the large round metallic spots of the male replaced by black spots
having little or no metallic color. A female from Iwahig, Palawan,
measures: Wing, 180; tail, 183; exposed culmen, 22; bill from nostril,
13; tarsus, 54; middle toe with claw, 48.

Young.--"An immature male resembles the female, but has tail and
greater coverts like those of adult male, though the ocelli are much
smaller and absent on inner webs of all the tail-feathers except
three middle pairs; one or two feathers of mantle have a metallic
bluish green patch in the middle and traces are apparent of black
plumage on mantle, wing-coverts, throat, and under parts." (Grant.)

This beautiful peacock pheasant, the "pavo real" of the Spaniards,
is confined to the Island of Palawan. Bourns and Worcester state that
the species is extremely shy, all of their specimens, including 18
adults beside young, being taken by natives in snares. They give the
following average measurements: Eleven males, length, 519; wing, 180;
tail, 222; culmen, 24; tarsus, 61; seven females, length, 420; wing,
166; tail, 150; culmen, 22; tarsus, 55.

Bourns and Worcester have shown that the character upon which
P. nehrkornæ was based--i.e., narrow superciliary stripes not confluent
on nape--is variable to a great degree and not dependent upon age,
so napoleonis is accepted as the correct specific name for the Palawan
bird, although originally applied to a specimen supposed to have come
from Luzon, an island in which the genus certainly does not exist.

Major John R. White has secured a fine series of these birds at the
Iwahig penal colony, and he states that he has seldom seen the birds
until snared by the natives.



Order HEMIPODII.

BUTTON QUAILS.

Culmen curved but not hooked; nostrils opening by a slit beneath a
horny scale; tarsi naked, without spurs; hind toe absent; wings short,
rounded, and curved to the body; rectrices short, soft, and nearly
hidden by the long fluffy coverts.



Family TURNICIDÆ.

Size small, the largest Philippine species under 200 mm. in length,
the others much smaller. Birds of this family resemble Excalfactoria in
general form but may be recognized by their lack of a hind toe. They
are usually found in grassy plains. The flight is rapid but of short
duration; the birds get up at one's feet but seldom flush a second
time. The nest is placed on the ground beneath a tuft of grass; eggs,
three or four, spotted with brown.

black; hind neck and sides of neck decorated with a collar of rich
chestnut. Iris white; bill yellow, slightly greenish toward tip; legs
greenish; nails flesh-colored. Length, 160. Three females measure:
Wing, 72 to 81; tail, 29 to 30.5; culmen, 13 to 14; tarsus, 23 to 25;
middle toe with claw, 20 to 23.

Young.--Immature birds of both sexes resemble the adult male but the
bars of breast are reduced to spots or to irregular V-shaped bars;
above more uniform, dull rusty brown and edges of feathers more or
less rusty; wing-coverts blackish brown, notched with white.

There is much variation in the color of the upper parts due to wear;
birds in fresh plumage (February, Manila) are largely chestnut above
and males may have a narrow chestnut collar; the rich color fades and
the feathers become abraded very rapidly. A male (March 17, Tarlac)
shows scarcely any chestnut and that of a faded hue. The species is
easily recognized in any plumage by the black bars (spots in young)
on breast.

Eggs.--"The eggs of the Philippine bustard quail are grayish white,
densely covered with specks and dots of yellowish brown and small
blotches of pale purple. The three examples in the collection
[collected by the Steere Expedition in Negros, November 10], are
very broad ovals and measure respectively: 28.4 by 21.3; 27 by 21.3;
26 by 21.3." (Oates.)

A nest believed to belong to this species was found in Mindoro,
March 23, 1905. It was made of dry grass and placed on the ground
in an old clearing, where it was well hidden by the surrounding
grass. The three eggs were slightly incubated; two of them measure 25
by 20 and the third measures 24.6 by 19.8. The ground-color is white,
closely speckled with dull greenish brown and occasional small spots
of various shades of lilac, the larger end rather thickly marked with
blotches of blackish brown. One specimen from Manila, July 30, 1908,
measures 23.5 by 18.5.

"Common about old paddy-fields and on grassy plains. It flies but a
short distance and then buries itself in the grass, where it runs
rapidly and hides so well that one is seldom able to flush a bird
the second time." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Pu-gong gu'-bat, Manila.

    Luzon (Everett, Heriot, Whitehead, McGregor, Worcester, Mearns).


Adult male.--Above mottled and spotted; head and sides of face black
with roundish white spots and some rusty edging to feathers; rest of
upper parts with large black centers to feathers whose edges are light
buff and tips rusty; a slight trace of a chestnut nuchal collar; chin
and middle of throat white; breast uniform rufous-chestnut; middle of
belly dirty white; flanks, thighs, and under tail-coverts dirty buff;
primaries brown with pale edges; secondaries mottled and with wider,

black spot. "Iris white, upper mandible grayish brown at tip, pale
yellow from nostrils back; lower mandible pale yellow, except tip
light brown, legs and feet light straw-yellow, except joints and
soles light brown; nails gray. Length, 165." (Worcester.) A specimen
from Benguet measures: Wing, 93; tail, 33; culmen, 15; tarsus, 25;
middle toe with claw, 24.

Adult female.--Similar to male but larger; throat and chin black;
chestnut of breast continued above as a wide nuchal collar. Iris
white; bill pale yellow, grayish at tip; legs dull yellow; nails
whitish. Length, 180; wing, 115; tail, 37; culmen, 17; tarsus, 29;
middle toe with claw, 27.5. These measurements are from a specimen
taken near Manila.

Young.--In young males the throat is more or less spotted with
black and many of the breast-feathers are subterminally spotted with
black. In young females the throat is more or less spotted with white.

This is much the largest of the Philippine button quails and appears
to be confined to the Island of Luzon.

Worcester's quail is known from four specimens which were purchased
in Quinta Market, Manila. It resembles T. whiteheadi but differs from
that species in having the bill much deeper. Major E. A. Mearns informs
me that he is quite sure that he saw a live bird of this species in
Manila, in August, 1907.



Order COLUMBIFORMES.

DOVES AND PIGEONS.


Tip of bill horny and strongly convex forming a "nail" which is often
of a shade or color different from that of the soft, contracted, basal
portion; covering of nostril generally tumid; toes four, three in
front, cleft to the base or with a slight web; hind toe not elevated;
legs and toes never much lengthened; tarsus either slightly longer or
slightly shorter than middle toe without claw; wing flat and rather
long; in several genera the primaries variously cut or attenuated;
tail usually square or slightly rounded; never forked; in Macropygia
and Geopelia the rectrices are greatly graduated. A few genera are
terrestrial, but most of them are more or less arboreal and generally
capable of strong, swift, and sustained flight. Their food is largely
grain and small seeds; the larger species feed on the fruits of trees,
rarely on the leaves. The nest is a slight structure of twigs placed on
the ground, in a shrub, or in a tall tree. Eggs one or two, pure white
or slightly cream-colored; in shape rather long, equal ended, ovals.

    Batan (McGregor); Calayan (McGregor); Camiguin N. (McGregor).


Adult male.--General color above olive-green, lighter and grayish on
neck and sides of neck; crown ochraceous-buff; lower parts uniform
green from chin to abdomen; middle of abdomen white, washed with pale
yellow; sides blue-gray; flanks and thighs dark olive-green, mixed
with fine lines of pale yellow; under tail-coverts pale yellowish
(the longest buffy), each with a wide, dark olive-green shaft-mark;
shoulders maroon connected by a maroon band across the back; primaries
and secondaries black; secondaries and greater coverts with narrow
margins of pale yellow; inner secondaries and tail dark green like
back; tail black below with a narrow gray tip. Bill light blue,
the tip whitish; skin about eye blue; inner ring of eye clear blue,
outer ring pink, a dusky intermediate ring; legs dull carmine, nails
pale blue. Length, about 355; three specimens measure: Wing, 188 to
197; tail, 125 to 130; exposed culmen, 19 to 20; tarsus, 24 to 27;
middle toe with claw, 38 to 40.

Adult female.--Differs from the male in lacking the ochraceous of
crown and the maroon of shoulders and back, the entire upper parts
being green. Three specimens measure: Wing, 185 to 189; tail, 118
to 125; culmen, 19 to 19.5; tarsus, 24 to 27; middle toe with claw,
35.5 to 37.5.

This species is closely related to Sphenocercus formosæ and specimens
of the two species should be compared. It is not uncommon in Calayan
and Camiguin. We were first led to search for it by hearing its
weird, prolonged cry which is remarkably like that of a child in
pain. Having located the tree in which one of these birds was resting
it was difficult to see the bird as its yellowish green under parts
were in perfect harmony with the color of the leafy branches.



Genus OSMOTRERON Bonaparte, 1854.

Length, 280 to 305 mm.; colors largely yellow or olive-green; primaries
black; secondaries and coverts with conspicuous yellow borders; tail
nearly square, moderate in length; under tail-coverts very long,

lemon-yellow; outer secondaries edged with pale straw-yellow; tail
black below with a wide, gray terminal band. Iris light glistening
blue; bill dark red at base, bluish beyond nostrils; feet and nails
lead-blue. Length, 280 to 305; three males measure: Wing, 153 to 158;
tail, 98 to 100; culmen from base, 20 to 23; tarsus, 23 to 24.

Adult female.--Somewhat similar to the male but general coloration
darker and greener; edging of wing-coverts paler; maroon of mantle and
wings and gray band in front of mantle wanting; under tail-coverts
with narrow, dark-green shaft-lines. A female from Lubang measures:
Wing, 165; tail, 104; culmen from base, 21; tarsus, 22.

This very showy dove is usually found feeding in fruit trees and
often in company with the smaller, congeneric species, O. vernans,
but the latter is a much rarer bird.



14. OSMOTRERON EVERETTI Rothschild.

EVERETT'S GREEN PIGEON.

    Bongao (Everett); Meimbun (Everett?); Sibutu (Everett); Sulu
    (Burbidge, Guillemard, Everett).


"Osmotreron everetti resembles O. axillaris from the Philippines, but
is altogether a larger bird; the purplish chestnut mantle is bordered
above by a very conspicuous interscapulary band of lavender-gray, of
the same color as the crown; this color is of a lighter shade than in
O. axillaris and the interscapulary band is much less distinct and not
so pure gray in the latter. In O. everetti the green of the neck and
breast is a shade lighter and more tinged with yellow, the abdomen
paler and more grayish along the middle. Length, about 279; wing,
161 to 165 ([female] 162 to 165); tail, 91 to 92; bill, 19; tarsus,
23. 'Iris greenish silvery' (Everett); 'iris pearly green; bill red at
base, blue at tip; feet pale slate.' (Guillemard.) I have no female
of true O. axillaris to compare, but the female of O. everetti seems
to be the larger, and the mantle much darker olive." (Rothschild.)

I have seen no specimens of Everett's green pigeon.

blue-gray; flanks and thighs dark olive-green, the latter streaked
with light lemon-yellow; under tail-coverts chestnut; back, rump,
mantle, and secondary-coverts dull gray-green, richer green on the
coverts; upper tail-coverts like rump but with a faint chestnut wash;
primaries, alula, primary-coverts, and outer secondaries black;
some of the primaries and secondaries edged with yellow; greater
coverts broadly margined with pale yellow, forming a conspicuous band;
rectrices slate-gray above, each with a black subterminal band and
washed with green near the base; rectrices blackish below with narrow
slate-gray tips. Base of bill black, tip pale blue; iris light yellow;
legs and feet coral-pink. Salvadori quotes the following iris colors
from Davidson: "Irides with three rings, the outer one rose-pink,
the next prussian-blue, the innermost ultramarine-blue." Length, 280;
wing, 147; tail, 92; culmen from base, 19; tarsus, 23.

Adult female.--Nearly all green; somewhat similar to the male but
darker green above; the lavender wanting on head and neck, and orange
wanting on breast, these parts being dark green; under tail-coverts
pale yellow, more or less washed with cinnamon on inner webs. One
female from Mariveles, Bataan Province, measures: Length, 280; wing,
148; tail, 93; culmen from base, 19; tarsus, 22.

"Young male.--Resembles the female, but with some trace of the
vinaceous purple color on the neck, and of the brown-orange on
the breast.

"Young female.--Has the rufescent color of the upper tail-coverts
scarcely visible, and the central tail-feathers more or less tinged
with green.

"Some specimens have the forehead and throat more or less
tinged with greenish, but they are not confined to a particular
locality. I have seen in the Museum of Paris a variety entirely of
a canary-yellow." (Salvadori.)

"Its nest is a mere platform of twigs, grass-stems, tendrils, and
leaves, measuring about 180 mm. in breadth. The eggs are nearly oval
in form, pure white in color, and measure 31 by 24." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)



Genus PHAPITRERON Bonaparte, 1854.

Length, 230 to 280 mm.; sexes alike in color; colors nearly uniform
brown of various shades; a wide iridescent band on neck; primaries
neither scooped nor cut; rectrices graduated and rounded and with
gray tips; under tail-coverts gray or dark buff. Birds of this genus
are closely related inter se, maculipectus alone showing a slight
departure from the type in its mottled breast. The species fall
naturally into two groups which might take the rank of subgenera
were anything to be gained thereby. The first five species (see key
to species), the amethystina group are rare deep-woods birds; their
colors are generally darker brown than those of the leucotis group
and the bill is noticeably longer and heavier, being longer than
tarsus. The five species of the leucotis group are fairly common in
their respective ranges; they are to be found in more open country or
even on the borders of rice-fields; in this group the tarsus equals,
or is slightly greater than, the culmen.

    Basilan (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


"Adult.--Above dark brown with greenish reflections; amethystine spot
on hind neck less blue than in P. amethystina; top of head brown,
forehead slightly lighter and nape slightly darker than crown; sides
of face and ear-coverts brown, paler than crown; a narrow, dark brown
streak under eye; chin and throat grayish fulvous; breast pearly ash;
abdomen, flanks, thighs, and under tail-coverts ochraceous-brown;
under surface of tail brownish black with a broad, gray, terminal

color of its under surface." (Bourns and Worcester.)

This species is very distinct from P. amethystina being smaller and
differently colored. A male measures: Length, 267; wing, 135; tail,
100; culmen from base, 25.



19. PHAPITRERON FRONTALIS Bourns and Worcester.

CEBU AMETHYSTINE PIGEON.


    Phabotreron frontalis Bourns and Worcester, Minnesota
    Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers (1894), 1, 10; Sharpe, Hand-List
    (1899), 1, 55.
    Phapitreron frontalis McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 10.

    Cebu (Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult.--General color of upper surface as in P. brunneiceps but
forehead and crown lighter, nape washed with ashy gray, and lacking
metallic gloss; tail glossed with dull bronze instead of amethystine
and the terminal band less strongly marked than in brunneiceps;
under surface much as in brunneiceps but everywhere darker; under
tail-coverts ashy gray, slightly tipped with fulvous; tail much as in
brunneiceps, the outer web of outer pair of feathers being, however,
light brown; basal half of shafts dirty whitish; apical fourth white,
rest brown. Iris pale orange; bill black; legs and feet purple;
nails light brown. Sexes alike. Length, 260; wing, 140; tail, 100;
culmen, 51; tarsus, 21." (Bourns and Worcester.)

The length of culmen given above (2 inches in original description)
is undoubtedly an error.

    (1906), 10.

    Negros (Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead).


"Adult male.--Upper surface exactly as in P. amethystina except
that the primaries are slightly darker; dark brown stripe under eye
extending from gape through ear-coverts to hind neck; below this
a white stripe and a second shorter dark stripe below the latter;
cheeks fulvous brown; chin and throat more ruddy brown; breast clear
ashy gray, each feather having an edging distinctly lighter than
its center, producing a beautiful mottled appearance; feathers on
center of fore breast washed with brown and forming a distinct patch;
feathers of abdomen lack the dark centers, and their edges washed
with light brown; thighs and under tail-coverts cinnamon-brown, much
lighter than in P. amethystina; under surface of tail-feathers dark
brown, nearly black, with faint metallic gloss and a broad, gray,
terminal band; shafts of feathers black changing to white at tips;
under surface of wing and axillars uniform fulvous brown. Bill
black; feet dark pink; nails dark brown, nearly black. Wing, 145;
tail, 115; culmen, 26; tarsus, 20. Length not taken from birds in
flesh. This beautiful species was obtained in the Island of Negros
on the mountains of the interior, where it is by no means common. It
is distinguished from all the other species of the genus by its fine
mottled breast." (Bourns and Worcester.)

    Catanduanes (Whitehead); Luzon (Meyer, Heriot, Everett, Steere
    Exp., Whitehead, McGregor); Mindoro (Steere Exp., Bourns &
    Worcester, Everett, McGregor, Porter).


Adult.--A black line from gape to nape below eye; below this a
white line from opposite the posterior border of eye to nape; above,
general color brown; forehead and crown dark gray; below brown; chin,
upper throat, and cheeks ruddy fulvous; lower breast and abdomen
slightly ochraceous, much paler posteriorly; under tail-coverts dark
pearl-gray; wings brown; primaries with pale edges; rectrices brown,
each with a wide, terminal, gray band. Metallic reflections; specimen
held toward the light, occiput, neck, sides of neck, throat, breast,
sides of body, and flanks bronze-green; a blue collar on hind neck and
a blue band across interscapulars; back, rump, and wing-coverts touched
with purple; when specimen is held away from the light the blue bands
change to green; the green of neck and lower parts becomes purple;
the back, wing-coverts, tail-coverts, and rectrices are touched with
violet and dark purple. Iris varies, usually mottled pinkish surrounded
by a narrow white ring or a pale blue ring; bill black; legs carmine;
nails horn-brown. Length, about 235. Three males average: Wing, 134;
tail, 81; culmen from base, 18; tarsus, 20.

Four eggs taken by Whitehead at Cape Engaño in May, 1895, are "glossy
and measure from 26.5 to 28.5 in length, and from 19.5 to 20 in
breadth." (Oates.)

"Fairly common in deep woods. Breeds in April. Legs and feet deep
pink; nails brown. Length, 260; wing, 127; tail, 95; tarsus, 19;
middle toe with claw, 29." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

This species is fairly abundant in the islands where it occurs. Several
nests were found in Mindoro; they were constructed of twisted plant
tendrils which material gave the nests the appearance of being made
of spiral springs. The nest was invariably placed in a small tree
and rested on a horizontal branch at from 2 to 6 meters from the
ground. Eggs and nestlings were found from April 8 to May 6.

    (1906), 10.

    Basilan (Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


Adult (sexes similar).--"Similar to P. leucotis, but the rufous
throat more vinous, and the occiput of a coppery amethystine, very
conspicuous; the back and wings of a more greenish hue. 'Iris light
warm brown; bill black; feet carmine.' (Everett.) Length, about 230;
wing, 127; tail, 91; bill, 15; tarsus, 20." (Salvadori.)

    Panay (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester); Sibuyan (Bourns &
    Worcester, McGregor); Tablas (Bourns & Worcester); Ticao
    (McGregor).

Adult.--Very similar to Phapitreron leucotis but smaller; chin, sides
of face, and upper throat much paler; the white line on auricular
region replaced by a wider line of pale fulvous from bill to nape. Bill
black; iris gray; legs dark scarlet; nails brown. Four specimens,
two of each sex, measure: Wing, 119 to 124 (122); tail, 90 to 96.5
(94); culmen from base, 17 to 18 (17.5); tarsus, 16.5 to 18 (17.5).

"Very common in the forests of the central Philippines. Iris dark
brown; legs and feet dark pink; nails leaden; bill black. Length,
229 to 250; wing, 119 to 127; tail, 84 to 96; culmen, 17 to 19;
middle toe with claw, 26 to 29." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



24. PHAPITRERON BREVIROSTRIS Tweeddale.

SHORT-BILLED PIGEON.


    Phabotreron brevirostris Tweeddale, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1877),
    549; Challenger Report (1881), 2, Zool. pt. 8, pl. 6; Salvadori,
    Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1893), 21, 69; Sharpe, Hand-List (1899),
    1, 55.
    Phapitreron brevirostris McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 10.

    Dinagat (Everett); Leyte (Everett, Steere Exp., Whitehead);
    Mindanao (Murray, Everett, Koch & Schadenberg, Goodfellow, Clemens,
    Celestino); Samar (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead);
    Siquijor (Bourns & Worcester); Sulu (Guillemard).


"Similar to P. leucotis, from which it differs in having the forehead
and throat grayish fulvous, the occiput constantly amethystine, and
the rectrices with a decided amethystine tinge; it resembles also
P. nigrorum, especially as regards the coloring of the forehead and
throat, but it differs in having the subocular streak white and the
occiput more amethystine. Length, about 240; wing, 124; tail, 99;
bill, 13; tarsus, 19." (Salvadori.)

"It seems to us that there must be something wrong about the Sulu
record of P. brevirostris. We obtained no pigeons of the P. leucotis
type in Sulu, and the single specimen obtained by us in Tawi Tawi
has been lost or destroyed, so that we are unable to identify it,
but it would be indeed remarkable if P. brevirostris should give way
to P. occipitalis in Basilan only to reappear in Sulu. In the face of
Count Salvadori's identification of Guillemard's specimen, however,
we have nothing to say.

"Iris purple; legs and feet deep purple; nails brown. Five birds from
Samar and Siquijor average: Length, 235; wing, 122; tail, 83; culmen,
19; tarsus, 19; middle toe with claw, 26. A female from Mindanao
is larger, measuring: Length, 250; wing, 127; tail, 94; culmen, 17;
tarsus, 19; middle toe with claw, 28." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Li-mú-con, Bohol.

    Bohol (Steere Exp., McGregor); Siquijor (Bourns & Worcester,
    Celestino).


Adult male (type).--General color brown, much darker above, with
iridescent reflections most pronounced on nape, mantle, and breast;
merging rather abruptly into dark gray of crown; occiput, nape, and
sides of head ruddy brown; from gape a narrow brown line passing
below eye with a wider white line underneath, both lines reaching
beyond ear-coverts; chin white, gradually changing to gray on throat
and ochraceous on breast and abdomen; under tail-coverts and a wide
band at end of tail pale french-gray; wings uniform with the back;
primaries with a narrow light brown edge on outer webs; with the bird
held toward the light the occiput and nape are glossed with green,
followed by a patch of metallic blue, this followed on interscapulars
by a wide band of metallic green extending to sides of neck and
narrowly bordered behind by blue; the wings and remaining upper parts
have a dull green gloss; with the bird held away from the light the
green changes to purple and this metallic color shows also on throat,
breast, and sides of neck. Length, 234; wing, 122; tail, 81; culmen
from base, 16; tarsus, 17.

Female.--Similar to the male. In this species the terminal half of
bill is black; basal half of bill, skin around eyes, and feet dull
crimson; iris brown; nails gray.

Egg.--A hard-shelled egg was taken from a female killed on June 7,
1906; another egg, obtained in the same manner four days later,
measures 27 by 21 and is pure white in color.

This species is most closely related to P. brevirostris but it differs
in having a white forehead and brown subocular line.

    Goodfellow); Mindoro (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Negros
    (Whitehead); Samar (Bourns & Worcester); Sibuyan (McGregor).


Adult (sexes alike).--Forehead pale gray with a yellow wash, blending
into light slate-gray mixed with green on center of crown; on back
of head a wide band of dark purple or deep cherry-red, extending
over ear-coverts and sides of face below the eyes; remainder of
upper parts, including wings and tail, nearly uniform, rich green;
rectrices and quills partly blue when held toward the light; whole
upper parts slightly bronze away from the light; feathers of chin and
upper throat white with a yellow wash on tips; lower throat and sides
of neck and breast light gray; breast covered by a large oval patch
of old-gold-yellow, just behind this a broad band of deep purple;
middle of abdomen pearl-gray and white; sides and flanks green;
under tail-coverts light buff, the inner webs largely green; rectrices
gray below with light gray tips, above very narrowly edged with light
ocherous; some of the primaries and secondaries narrowly edged with
buff; tips of the green tarsal feathers reaching toes. A male from
Sibuyan measures: Length, 340; wing, 160; tail, 115; culmen from base,
18; middle toe with claw, 35. A male from Basilan: Wing, 148; tail,
115; culmen from base, 18; middle toe with claw, 33. A female from
Mindoro: Length, 320; wing, 153; tail, 113; culmen from base, 19;
middle toe with claw, 34.

Young.--The immature bird differs from the adult in having top of head,
neck, and sides of face uniform green (or with a few purple feathers)
and the yellow and purple areas of breast indicated by a few scattered
feathers of these colors. The first primary is attenuated but not so
abruptly cut on inner web as it is in the adult. In a young female
from Sibuyan the bill was dull red at base; tip brown; feet pink;
nails black.

"Adult male.--Entire top of head dull crimson-red, the same color
being continued down the sides of the cheeks, on either side of
the throat; feathers surrounding the eye light red; hind cheek and
ear-coverts dusky black; back and sides of the neck and upper part of
the breast pearl-gray, forming a collar which completely separates the
dull crimson crown from the dusky black mantle and back; wings like
the back, but with green reflections; lower back, rump, and upper
tail-coverts bronze-brown with green reflections; primary quills
black, finely edged with pale yellow; the two outer secondaries are
similarly margined, the remainder edged with crimson along the middle
of the outer web, the crimson barbs being loose and free and forming a
large patch on the wing; tail bronze-brown, broadly edged with brownish
gray, beneath dark gray tipped with whitish; chin and middle of throat
brownish buff; in the center of the gray breast a large patch of bright
orange-vermilion washed with lake, shading into deep red-lake below;
this is followed by a patch of creamy white; rest of under parts dull
pearly gray, most of the feathers finely edged with creamy yellow;
under tail-coverts buff, with brownish gray centers. 'Eye: inner ring
yellow, outer lake-red; bill at base brick-red, tipped with yellow;
feet deep coral-red.' (Whitehead.) Length, 400; wing, 180; tail, 129;
tarsus, 32.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, but crown of a less crimson tinge;
lower part of the back, rump, and tail bronze-green, distinctly greener
than in the male; upper part of the breast-patch orange-red without
the crimson wash. Length, 373; wing, 173; tail, 114; tarsus, 29.

"Young male.--The whole of the upper parts is brownish bronze shot
with green; the dull crimson of the top of the head and the free
crimson webs of the secondaries are just beginning to make their
appearance; the whole of the feathers of the chest and upper breast
are gray, widely tipped with bronze-green, the only patches of pure
gray feathers being visible on each side of the neck. The orange-red
breast-patch is represented by a deep orange feather in the middle
of the chest and some dark carmine feathers. Otherwise the rest of
the plumage is much like that of the adult." (Grant.)

Marche's fruit pigeon was described in 1880 from a single specimen
which remained unique for fifteen years when Whitehead rediscovered
the species in Lepanto. So far as we at present know, this species
is confined to this subprovince and the neighboring subprovince of
Bontoc. The Igorots say that at certain seasons of the year these birds
become very fat and heavy and that they are then taken by pursuing
them until they are exhausted. This account is probably correct as
the specimens seen in the possession of the Igorots are not injured,
while birds taken in snares or with bird-lime are seldom fit for
specimens. This species may be recognized at once by the large red
patch on the secondaries. In 1903 a pigeon, probably of this species,
was killed in Bontoc by the Hon. Dean C. Worcester but the skin
was lost.

    (Worcester); Sibuyan (McGregor); Tablas (Bourns & Worcester).


Adult male.--Chin black; head, neck, throat, and breast pearl-gray,
washed with dull green on occiput and hind neck, washed with ocherous
yellow on throat and crop; remainder of upper parts green, brightest on
wings and tail, the latter tipped with dull yellowish brown; primaries
edged with white near their tips; some of the secondaries edged with
ocherous-yellow; behind the gray of breast a dark chestnut band,
blackish on its anterior border; middle of abdomen white, washed with
cinnamon or in some specimens with yellowish buff; under tail-coverts
cinnamon; rectrices below, brown with gray tips; remainder of under
parts dull green. Iris bright red; bill bright yellow; base of lower
mandible, and feet dark crimson; nails dark brown. Length, 280 to
305; measurements of three specimens give: Wing, 144 to 145; tail,
104 to 105; culmen from base, 19 to 20; tarsus, 18 to 20.

Adult female.--Forehead blue-gray; chin black; throat and breast green;
dark chestnut pectoral-band, and other parts, as in the male. A female
from Sibuyan has the wing, 145, and tail, 104; a female from Calayan
is larger; wing, 157; tail, 114.

Young.--Green, chin cinnamon; pectoral-band wanting or indicated by
a few chestnut feathers; abdomen white or washed with buff; under
tail-coverts slightly paler than in the adult.

Leclancher's pigeon is generally found in forest and, although
widely distributed, it does not occur in great numbers, except
when feeding in fruit trees; it appears to be strictly arboreal in
habits. Specimens from Camiguin, Calayan, and Batan are considerably
larger than specimens from more southern islands. The nest as observed
in Camiguin, north of Luzon, was a slight platform of twigs placed on
a horizontal branch at from 1.5 to 4.5 meters from the ground. Four
nests contained but one egg each. Three eggs are white in color and
measure, respectively: 35 by 23, 35 by 25, and 31 by 24.



Genus LAMPROTRERON Bonaparte, 1854.

Lamprotreron is distinguished from all other Philippine genera by
having the breast-feathers bifurcated, as if the tip of the shaft
had been cut off of each feather.

"Adult male.--General color above parrot-green, the inner
wing-coverts, scapulars, and inner quills with an oval black spot
near the ends; entire head above aster-purple; hind neck and sides
of neck dragon's-blood-red, shading off into the green of the mantle;
sides of occiput and ear-coverts green, becoming gray on malar region,
chin, throat, and jugulum; the upper breast rose-purple, the feathers
on chest and jugulum forked at the tip (as if the middle part of
the web had been cut out with scissors); passing on lower breast
into a broad band of blackish plum-purple; on and near the carpal
edge a large spot of this color; sides, thighs, and flanks green,
thighs grayer, flanks tipped with naples-yellow; abdomen and under
tail-coverts yellowish white, the inner webs of the latter partly
green; center tail-feathers above green, grayish at tip, all the
lateral tail-feathers blackish, tipped with gray, washed with green;
tail below dusky grayish, terminal bar whitish; quills above black,
washed externally with green, finely edged with yellowish; wings below
slaty, the first primary much attenuated for about 2 cm. and incurved.

"Adult female.--Above all parrot-green, except for a patch of
aster-purple on crown and occiput, and purplish black spots on the
scapulars and inner-coverts; breast green, without rose-purple and
the dark plum-purple band of the male.

"Immature male.--Closely resembling the female; forehead green with
the purple feathers of the crown intermingled; dark purple breast-band
commencing to form; breast grayer than in the female.

"Young in first plumage.--Bright parrot-green, the wing-coverts and
secondaries broadly margined with light yellow, the back, rump, and
scapulars, and breast more finely margined with yellow; remaining
under parts much as in the female; tail tipped with yellowish white;
no purple on head or elsewhere.

"Wing, 128 to 140; tail, 95; tarsus, 22; culmen from cranium suture,
17 to 19." (Meyer and Wiglesworth.)

    (Burbidge, Guillemard, Bourns & Worcester); Tawi Tawi (Bourns &
    Worcester). Banguey.


Adult male.--Bright leaf-green, mantle slightly yellowish; head, neck,
and throat pearly gray; chin and upper throat yellow; a large patch
on occiput and hind neck black; lower abdomen and short tail-coverts
bright yellow; longer tail-coverts bright carmine, narrowly tipped
with yellow; secondaries and greater coverts very narrowly edged with
yellow. Eyelids, iris, and bill greenish yellow; feet rose-pink;
nails brown. Length, 240. Two males from Basilan, wing, 123, 116;
tail, 85; exposed culmen, 16, 15; middle toe with claw, 26.

Adult female.--Entirely green, except the under tail-coverts which
are green, washed with carmine, and narrowly tipped with yellow. Two
females from Basilan measure: Wing, 121, 118; tail, 79, 80; exposed
culmen, 16, 14; middle toe with claw, 26, 25.

Young.--Similar to the adult female but with little or no carmine on
under tail-coverts.

"This, the most northern form of the Spilotreron group, is very
nearly related to the most southern one, from which it is not easily
distinguished. The slight purple tinge of the black occipital spot,
on which Dr. Meyer relies to separate the Basilan bird, appears only
in certain individuals, but is absent in the majority of specimens. As
to the collar of the bird from Banguey, which is described as whitish
gray, I do not find that it is different from that of the specimens
from other localities." (Salvadori.)

"The blue spot on the nape on which Meyer relies to separate the
Basilan birds is a minus quantity in our five specimens from that
island, though they are in breeding plumage. This species is quite
common in Sulu and Tawi Tawi, and is sometimes found feeding in
isolated trees in open fields.

"Iris yellow; legs dark pink; feet same color; nails nearly black; bill
and eye-wattle light greenish yellow. Length, 230; wing, 121; tail,
81; culmen, 33; middle toe with claw, 29." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"This large fruit pigeon is closely related to Muscadivora pickeringi
(Cassin) from Mangsee Island north of Borneo, on the west side of
the Sulu Sea, of which the type (No. 15732) is in United States
National Museum. The size is practically the same; but the colors
differ as follows: General coloration paler; the vinous-gray of the
head and under parts is darker, the gray of lower hind neck extends
farther down on the mantle, the white around the base of the bill and
surrounding the eye is more extensive, the back and rump are paler and
less brownish gray, the wings are paler, grayer and less greenish,
and the under tail-coverts less reddish. Iris purplish red; region
of the nostrils dark plumbeous; bill light plumbeous; naked eyelid
deep vinaceous; bare space around eye plumbeous; feet vinaceous,
flesh-color on under side of toes; claws plumbeous. Three adult males:

Genus PTILOCOLPA Bonaparte, 1854.

Sexes unlike in plumage; bill and gape rather small compared with
Muscadivores; nostril opening elongate; first primary attenuated
and scooped on inner web; second primary slightly scooped; inner
primaries obliquely cut at tip; the outline sinuous and outer web
extending beyond shaft and inner web; tarsus partly feathered.

    Luzon (Gevers, Heriot, Whitehead, McGregor); Mindoro (Steere
    Exp., Whitehead, McGregor, Porter); Mindanao (Everett, Koch &
    Schadenberg); [7] Sibuyan (McGregor).


Adult male.--All of head, neck all around, back and interscapulars
light gray; chin white; lower throat delicate light gray, bordered
behind by a narrow white band and this followed by a wide, dark gray
band on fore breast; lower breast, abdomen, and flanks dark chestnut,
darker and slightly purplish on breast; sides gray; alula, primaries,
and their coverts, dark, glossy blue-green; secondaries blue-green,
mealy along outer edges; wing-coverts and inner secondaries canescent,
the smaller feathers each with a dark spot at tip; rump-feathers
canescent with glossy green centers and light purple edges; rectrices
and upper coverts glossy blue-green, shafts black; rectrices black
below, except outermost pair which are brown with white shafts. Iris
white mottled with pink; bill rose-pink, the "nail" white; legs
rose-pink, nails brown. Two males from Benguet, Luzon, average:
Length, 356; wing, 216; tail, 131; culmen from base, 22; tarsus, 22.

Adult female.--Somewhat similar to the male but without a white band
across the crop; fore breast light purple dulled by its slightly mealy
look; held toward the light, it becomes green and away from the light,
slightly metallic copper-red washed with vinous; rest of under parts
much lighter chestnut than in male; wing-coverts glossy green, lesser
and median coverts with blue spots at tips; interscapulars vinous
and slightly mealy; lower back and rump green with touches of deep
blue. The following notes are from an adult female taken in Benguet,
Luzon: Iris with an inner white ring and outer pinkish ring; eyelids
dirty white; bare skin about eyes blue-gray; bill deep rose-red,
tip white; legs and feet rose-red, soles yellowish; nails brown.

Young.--Immature birds have the fore breast chestnut, uniform with
the abdomen, thus not resembling the adult plumage of either sex;
wings rich metallic green, or copper-red, without canescence and the
primaries neither scooped nor cut as are those of the adult.

The plumage of the male and female in the gray-breasted fruit pigeon is
so different that the sexes were long considered to represent distinct
species. Grant, working on the material gathered by Whitehead, has
shown that these differences are sexual and not specific and more
recently collected material sustains his conclusions.

In habits these birds are quite similar to the slightly larger imperial
pigeons or baluds. They feed on large seeds or nuts and are often
found in considerable numbers in fruiting trees.

Adult (sexes alike).--Head and a narrow band across throat pale gray,
vinous on crown and occiput; a large patch of light chestnut on chin;
lower breast and abdomen pale vinous; abdomen freckled with chestnut,
the color becoming rich chestnut-brown on flanks, thighs, and under
tail-coverts; tail black below, crossed at about 40 mm. from tip by a
pale gray band which shows both above and below; when the specimen
is held toward the light, the crop, breast, sides of neck, and
upper parts, except head, are rich green; held away from the light,
tail and its coverts, rump, distal wing-coverts, secondaries, and
breast become largely coppery or bronze-color; hind neck vinaceous
gray, proximal wing-coverts, tertials, and interscapular region
deep vinous-purple. Bill black; "iris indian-yellow, passing into
red on outer ring;" legs, feet, and skin about eye crimson; nails
gray. Length, 400 to 430; a male from Sibuyan measures: Wing, 235;
tail, 156; culmen from base, 24; tarsus, 32; a female from Sibuyan,
wing, 235; tail, 154; culmen from base, 24; tarsus, 27.

"Comparatively rare and usually frequents the loftiest trees. For
a long time we mistook its deep booming note for the hoot of some
great owl. Occasionally it comes down into low second-growth where
it is easily shot, being very stupid about making its escape.

"Iris with outer red and inner yellow or brown ring; legs and feet
red; nails dark brown; bill black; eyelids red. Length 400." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)



41. ZONOPHAPS MINDORENSIS (Whitehead).

MINDORO ZONE-TAILED PIGEON.


    Carpophaga mindorensis Whitehead, Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. (1896),

    Zonophaps mindorensis Sharpe, Hand-List (1899), 1, 65; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 12.

    Mindoro (Whitehead).


"Adult male.--Most nearly allied to Carpophaga radiata (Quoy and
Gaimard) but much larger. Top of head, neck, breast, and rest of under
parts bluish slate-gray, darkest on belly and under tail-coverts, the
latter indistinctly edged with rufous; forehead, cheeks, and throat
pale whitish pink; feathers surrounding eye and forming a patch above
ear-coverts, blackish gray; hind neck gradually shading into sooty
black on the mantle and interscapulary region; scapulars and inner
wing-coverts bronze-lake, changing to bronze-green on the rest of the
wings, rump, and upper tail-coverts; primary quills blackish gray,
the inner ones glossed on the outer web and toward the extremity with
metallic green; tail-feathers black, glossed with purple and green,
and with a wide gray band across the middle; under wing-coverts and
axillars slightly glossed with bronze. Length, 482; exposed culmen,
23; wing, 234; tail, 178; tarsus, 35; middle toe with claw, 51.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male but rather smaller, and the under
tail-coverts distinctly margined with chestnut. Length, 445; exposed
culmen, 23; wing, 223; tail, 159; tarsus, 33; middle toe with claw,
46." (Whitehead.)

This species is much larger than Zonophaps poliocephala from which
it differs also in the following points: A large black patch on
ear-coverts and surrounding eye; forehead, cheeks, and chin fawn-color;
occiput, neck, crop, breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts gray.

"Male.--Iris bright yellow, with an outer ring of red; orbital skin
lake-red, with a grayish yellow space between the rings; bill black;
feet coral-pink. Female: Iris straw-yellow, with an outer ring of
golden brown; orbital skin orange-yellow, bill olive-brown, black at
tip; feet salmon-red; nails black.

"This species is more often met with singly or in pairs, but sometimes
as many as four birds were seen together; they were feeding on some
large purple colored fruits as big as a pigeon's egg. C. mindorensis,
like the last species (Zonophaps poliocephala), has a conspicuous
fleshy ring outside the eyelid. * * * During dull misty weather,
especially just after daybreak, the penetrating booming note is more
often heard than on clear days." (Whitehead.)

So far as known the species is confined to the highlands of Mindoro
at an elevation of between 1,200 and 1,800 meters.



Genus MYRISTICIVORA Reichenbach, 1852.

Inner webs of first and second primaries very slightly attenuated;
tarsus feathered in front for half its length. This genus is remarkable
for its coloration; parts of the wings and tail, slate or black,
the rest of the plumage pale creamy white.

Adult (sexes alike).--General color pale creamy white; head and sides
of head more or less ochraceous-yellow; wing-coverts and edge of wing
white; alula, primary-coverts, primaries, and most of the secondaries
black; outer web of longer primaries mealy; basal half, or more,
of rectrices and under tail-coverts light yellow, the coverts in
some specimens spotted with black; end of tail marked with a wide
black band which is widest on middle rectrices. Iris dark brown;
bill dull blue with a black tip; eyelids, legs, and feet dark blue;
nails black. Length, about 380; a male from Ticao measures: Wing, 229;
tail, 127; culmen from base, 25; tarsus, 27; a female from Cresta de
Gallo, wing, 229; tail, 127; culmen from base, 24; tarsus, 29.

The camaso, or balud blanco, being a very conspicuous bird, is well
known to both natives and Spaniards and can not be mistaken for
any other species of Philippine pigeon. The species is irregular
in distribution; it is often abundant on a small island and rare,
or entirely wanting, on a larger neighboring island. Worcester and
Bourns found it especially abundant in Siquijor. No specimens were
taken by Whitehead and it is unrecorded from Luzon, although there
seems to be no reason why it should be absent from that island.

    (Everett); Sibuyan (McGregor); Sulu (Burbidge); Tawi Tawi (Bourns
    & Worcester).


Adult male.--Head, sides of neck and breast, and lower parts bright
cinnamon-rufous, much lighter on throat and chin, darker on flanks,
under tail-coverts, and rectrices; above including wings and tail
dark brown; most of the feathers except remiges and rectrices,
edged with fine rufous dots; feathers of neck covered with irregular
vermiculations of rufous and blackish brown; sides of neck and of
body and crop marked with a few black cross-lines; neck and its sides
glossed with amethystine changing to green; metallic colors extending
faintly onto back and rump; rectrices from above dark brown, except
two outermost pairs which are cinnamon-rufous, each crossed by a
diagonal black bar; next pair similar but more obscurely colored;
inner webs of primaries edged with cinnamon. Iris of three rings,
outermost reddish or crimson, middle ring black, innermost pale
straw; skin around eye dirty brown; eyelids and basal half of bill
crimson; distal end of bill brown; legs and feet bright crimson;
nails brown. Length, about 394; three males average, wing, 189; tail,
200; exposed culmen, 16; tarsus, 23.

Adult female.--Nearly like the male but with very little if any
metallic gloss; neck and its sides black, barred with light cinnamon;
crop and lower throat more or less barred and vermiculated with black.

Young.--A young bird from Sibuyan with tail less than half grown
differs from the adult female in the throat- and breast-feathers being
blackish brown, edged with rufous, and in having bars of upper parts
more sharply cut, being produced by solid colors rather than by dots;
the rectrices seen from above have narrow rufous tips and from below,
each is crossed by a narrow, subterminal gray line.

The adult plumage is here described from a pair of birds taken at
Irisan, Benguet Province, on May 1, 1903. That these were breeding
birds was shown by dissection and was noted on the tags. If the
rusty edges are absent from the wing-coverts of fully adult birds
then it must require two or possibly three years for them to attain
that plumage.

"Exceedingly common in some localities. Frequents open ground
surrounded by patches of second growth. When flushed it frequently
alights in trees. Eyes yellow; legs and feet red. Length, 370;
culmen, 19; wing, 165; tail, 184; tarsus, 22; middle toe with claw,
33." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Common among the mountains of north Luzon, and found nesting on
the summit of Monte Data, where the large tracts of dead bracken
ferns afford it good protection. I saw a young one nearly ready
to fly on 28th of January on this mountain. This dove is also
plentiful in the lowland forests, and is distributed throughout the
Archipelago." (Whitehead.)

"Enormously abundant in many localities, especially about the
rice-fields after harvest. Everywhere common in open country. It is
a favorite cage bird with the natives, who call it took-moo from its
note. The nest, which is a mere platform of sticks and twigs, is placed
on the branch of some low tree or bush. The eggs are pure white in
color, and oval in form, with both ends rather sharply pointed. They
measure 28.4 to 30.5 in length by 20.8 to 21.3 in breadth.

feathers of neck black with white tips; feathers of upper parts
brown with paler, dull, rusty edges and dark shaft-stripes, the
stripes widest on tertials and wing-coverts; distal coverts in each
series pearl-gray, outer webs white; quills brown with narrow pale
edges; lower parts vinous; paler, nearly white on chin; abdomen
white washed with buff; under tail-coverts white; three outer
tail-feathers black broadly tipped with white; next pair black,
tipped with gray; two central feathers uniform brown, next pair black
with a broad, terminal, brown band. "Iris reddish pearl; bill black;
feet pinkish." (Wallace.) Length, about 300; wing, 145; tail, 150;
exposed culmen, 17; tarsus, 22.

Young.--"More rufescent above and beneath; feathers of the hind neck
of a pale brown with grayish edges." (Salvadori.)

The Malay spotted dove occurs in small numbers as a winter visitant
to Balabac and Palawan. Whitehead says it is "scarce and very local"
in Palawan; Celestino took several specimens at Puerto Princesa.



Subfamily GEOPELIINÆ.

Genus GEOPELIA Swainson, 1837.

Tip of first primary very slender; tail long and greatly graduated,
and its feathers very slender. This genus contains the smallest
Philippine doves.

    Verde (McGregor). Siam, Southern Tenasserim, Malay Peninsula,
    Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, Celebes, Amboina.


Adult male.--Anterior half of head, sides of face, chin, and upper
throat pearl-gray; a little lighter on chin and forehead; hind crown
and nape uniform dull reddish brown; rest of upper parts, including
wing-coverts, earthy brown; neck and sides of neck decorated
with sharply cut black and white bars (on hind neck washed with
brown); above, the bars become obliterated posteriorly leaving the
feathers uniform brown with black tips which persist to longest upper
tail-coverts; below, along sides and flanks the black bars are reduced
in width; middle of breast vinaceous-pink; middle of abdomen, vent,
and under tail-coverts white and unbarred, primaries and secondaries
brown, narrowly edged with brown or gray; lining of wing cinnamon
with narrow black bars; rectrices brown, all but middle pair with
wide white tips. Iris pale blue; bill and bare skin about eyes blue;
legs and feet dull red; nails light horn. Length, 216 to 229. Five
males yield the following measurements: Wing, 94 to 100 (98); tail,
91 to 104 (96); exposed culmen, 14 to 15 (14.5); tarsus, 19 to 20
(19.5); middle toe with claw, 22 to 24 (23).

Adult female.--Like the male; said to be less reddish on the occiput
but this difference is not very obvious except where fully adult
birds are compared.

Young.--Above like the adult but bars continued from nape onto
top of head; wing-coverts barred with brown, buff, and rusty brown;
secondaries edged with rusty buff; inner webs of primary-coverts rusty
brown; no vinaceous-pink on breast which is barred like the sides.

In the full-plumaged bird the bars encroach upon the pink area of
breast and are more strongly developed on sides and flanks than in
less mature individuals. In most specimens the primary-coverts are
tipped with cinnamon but in fine plumage these coverts are uniform
brown and the primaries from third to eighth inclusive, are narrowly
edged with red near their bases.

The nest of this species is a frail mass of twigs with scarcely
any hollow; it is placed on the branch of a bush, in a small tree,
or according to Whitehead, among hanging creepers. Near Mariveles,
Bataan, a nest with fresh eggs was found February 27, 1902. The two
oval eggs are pure white.

The barred dove, while one of the commonest species in Luzon, occurs
but rarely in other islands of the Archipelago. It is often found
feeding in rice-fields after the grain has been harvested and is
brought into the Manila markets from neighboring towns.



Subfamily PHABINÆ.

Genus CHALCOPHAPS Gould, 1843.

Bill slender; wing short; tail short and slightly rounded, its feathers

Adult male.--Forehead and superciliary stripe white, shading into
slate-blue on crown and nape; upper back and neck washed with
slate-blue; primaries, primary-coverts, and alula dull brown; small
lesser coverts on shoulder tipped with white; rest of wings and back
rich metallic green, changing to rich bronze when specimen is held
away from the light; back metallic copper-color crossed near middle
by a band of blue-gray; another blue-gray band between back and rump;
upper tail-coverts dark slate with black tips; sides of neck and
face and lower parts vinaceous-purple, paler on chin and on abdomen,
the former sometimes washed with brown; basal under tail-coverts
blue-gray, the longest ones blackish; rectrices mostly blackish,
outermost pair mostly pearl-gray above, clearest on outer web, with
a subterminal black band; next two pairs similar but variable. Iris
brown; bill coral-red, dark at base; legs dark carmine; feet bluish;
nails horn. A specimen from Mindoro measures: Length, 255; wing, 152;
tail, 92; culmen from base, 23; tarsus, 27; middle toe with claw, 30.

Adult female.--In color pattern like the male from which it differs
chiefly in having the vinaceous-purple replaced by brown, more or
less faintly glossed with purple; whole head brown, superciliary
stripe much reduced; small lesser wing-coverts brown; rump and upper
tail-coverts cinnamon-brown with blackish tips and slight purple
gloss; rectrices much as in male but second, third, and fourth outer
pairs more or less rufous basally. A specimen from Masbate measures:
Length, 241; wing, 139; tail, 85; culmen from base, 20; tarsus, 26;
middle toe with claw, 28.

Young.--A young male has top and sides of head brown, the tips of
many feathers cinnamon or rusty, especially those about the eyes;
metallic colors of back and wings largely replaced by dusky brown and
many of the wing-coverts, as well as some primaries and secondaries,
tipped and mottled with rusty cinnamon; sides of neck, breast, and
abdomen barred with cinnamon and blackish brown. Iris dark brown;
bill dull reddish brown; legs dull pink; nails slate.

"Exceedingly common throughout the group. Invariably found on the
ground and usually in deep woods. Usually alights on the ground again
when flushed. Eyes dark brown; bill dark red; legs and feet light to
dark red; nails light brown. Seven specimens average, 243 in length;
wing, 141; tail, 88; culmen, 22; tarsus, 24; middle toe and claw,
29." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

The bronze-winged dove, because of its wide distribution, is a species
little valued by the collector but its solitary and unobtrusive
habits usually lead the novice to mistake it for a rarity. In no place
abundant, the species may be found in nearly every island where forest,
or even a small growth of trees, exists to afford protected feeding
grounds. Oates records two eggs of this species which were collected
in Mindoro by the Steere Expedition.

    Pu-ña-lá-da, Manila and generally.

    Luzon (Meyer, Everett, Heriot, Steere Exp., Whitehead, McGregor,
    Celestino).


Adult (sexes similar).--Top of head, from base of bill to hind border
of eye, gray; rest of upper parts dark brown, each feather, except
rectrices and their coverts, edged with metallic green or purple,
according to the light; the edging wider on interscapulars; sides
of neck similar to back; chin, throat, and sides of face below eyes
pure white; a patch of blood-red on the stiffish feathers of crop,
shading into pale salmon on lower breast and abdomen; sides gray;
flanks, thighs, and under tail-coverts light buff; primaries and
secondaries brown, edges reddish brown, basal half of inner web
of primaries cinnamon; greater and median coverts reddish brown
with wide gray tips forming two gray bands across each wing; lesser
coverts gray; two middle pairs of rectrices brown on upper surface;
the other rectrices gray, each with a subterminal black bar.

Length, about 280. A male from Bataan Province, Luzon, measures: Wing,
148; tail, 112; culmen from base, 21; tarsus, 35. A female from the
same province measures: Wing, 145; tail, 102; culmen from base, 20;
tarsus, 32.

This beautiful dove is often found in the Manila markets; it is a
well-known favorite of the Spaniards. The species is commonly known
as puñalada which means "stabbed with a dagger." The Calamianes record
of this species is doubtless an error.

    Basilan (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Leyte
    (Whitehead); Mindanao (Everett, Steere Exp.); Samar (Bourns &
    Worcester).


Adult male and female.--Head, cheeks, neck, and mantle dark metallic
green changing to metallic purple; back, rump, and tail-coverts
chestnut, some of the feathers with amethystine edges; white of
chin and throat extending backward on each side of a large dark
red crop-patch; rest of under parts rich buffy brown, lighter
on tail-coverts, nearly white on abdomen; alula, primaries, and
primary-coverts dark brown; secondaries chestnut; upper lesser
coverts brown, edged with metallic green changing to amethystine;
remainder of lesser coverts broadly tipped with gray; median and
greater coverts chestnut, tipped with gray forming wing-bands; middle
tail-feathers chestnut, the others blackish with wide gray tips. A
male from Basilan: Length, 280; wing, 153; tail, 110; exposed culmen,
19; tarsus, 36. A female from Basilan: Wing, 145; tail, 95; exposed
culmen, 19; tarsus, 34.

"Eyes lilac; legs light pink; feet dark pink; nails nearly white;
upper mandible black, lower gray. Seven specimens average as follows:
Length, 355; culmen, 21; wing, 146; tail, 95; tarsus, 32; middle toe
with claw, 9.

"We consider the Sulu record of this species extremely doubtful. We
saw a Phlegoenas there which we failed to obtain. It seems to us more
probable, however, from the close relationship of the known birds of
Sulu to those of Tawi Tawi that the species in question is P. menagei.

"The habits of the Philippine representatives of this genus are the
same. The birds are invariably found on the ground in the forest. They
run very rapidly, and in close cover frequently escape in this way
without taking wing. When flushed they invariably alight on the
ground again, and run rapidly after alighting, so that they are
very difficult to kill. P. criniger is fairly abundant in Basilan,
but much rarer in Samar." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Adult.--"Feathers of the head, upper part of cheeks, hind neck, sides
of breast, mantle, and lesser wing-coverts (except the distal series)
gray, broadly edged with dark metallic green, changing to amethystine;
back and rump purplish chestnut with amethystine margins to feathers;
upper tail-coverts purplish chestnut; primaries dusky, with margins
of outer webs and basal two-thirds of inner webs chestnut; secondaries
chestnut, dusky toward tips of inner webs; greater and median coverts
purplish chestnut; lesser coverts with two or three of their distal
rows subterminally gray, broadly margined with white, the latter
color forming a conspicuous band across wing; lining of wing and under
wing-coverts chestnut; central pair of tail-feathers dark chestnut,
the remainder gray with a broad subapical band of black; lower part
of cheeks, throat, fore neck, breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts
white (abdomen washed with fawn in some specimens); flanks and thighs
fawn, almost white in some examples; patch on crop-region small and
blood-red; pectoral band narrow and incomplete, formed by the metallic
green margins to some of the breast feathers. Feet red. Wing, 159;
tail, 104; culmen, 18; tarsus, 37." (Clarke.)

Keay's blood-breasted pigeon is easily recognized by the conspicuous
white band across the wing.

gray band, least distinct on central pair; wing-coverts dark brown,
broadly tipped with metallic green except outer series, which are
broadly tipped with ashy gray; primary- and secondary-coverts and
secondaries fulvous-brown, the outer half of outer webs of feathers
rich rufous-brown, the inner secondaries having the entire outer web,
and tip of inner web, of this color; primaries fulvous-brown faintly
washed with rufous-brown on basal half of outer webs; lores, a narrow
line under eye, and ear-coverts nearly black with a faint wash of
metallic green; metallic green of back and sides of neck continued
in a distinct band across the breast, only slightly interrupted at
center of breast and inclosing a beautiful orange plastron formed by
the bristle-like tips of the feathers of the fore breast; basal portion
of these feathers as well as chin, throat, sides of face, and sides of

    (1906), 15.

    Mindoro (Platen, Schmacker, Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


Adult (sexes similar).--Head and neck dark metallic green changing
to amethystine; scapulars, back, and rump chestnut, many of the
feathers edged with metallic green; below white becoming faint buff or
ochraceous on abdomen, flanks, and tail-coverts; finely speckled with
gray on sides of breast; red crop-patch very small; alula, primaries,
and primary-coverts brown; secondaries and coverts chestnut, except
some of the lesser series which are blackish with broad light gray

exposed culmen, 20; tarsus, 34. A female: Wing, 141; tail, 100;
exposed culmen, 20; tarsus, 34.

Two nests with eggs were collected on the Baco River in 1905. The
first was taken April 28, and was placed 1.5 meters from the ground
on a horizontal limb of a small tree. The two eggs were advanced in
incubation. They measure 30 by 22 and 29 by 22. The second nest was
similarly placed in a shrub. The nest measures 200 by 280 mm. across
the top and is very shallow, the outside depth being about 50 mm. On
the bottom are a number of rather large leaves and sticks, topped by
fine rootlets and spiral plant-tendrils. The materials were poorly put
together so that a large part of the bottom fell off when the nest
was removed from its site. The two eggs were well incubated. They
measure 29 by 22 and 30 by 21. Their color is light cream.

"Common in the old forests in the interior of Mindoro, but very
difficult to shoot. We found its nest in a tangle of vines about two
meters above the ground. The female flew from the nest to the ground
and pretended to be lame. The nest, which contained two young birds,
was found in the month of May." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Subfamily CALOENADINÆ.

Genus CALOENAS Gray, 1840.

The genus Caloenas is distinguished by having the feathers of the
neck long, narrow, and pointed; bill deep, with a knob on the base

Adult male.--Head, neck, throat, and breast dark slate or blue-black;
long neck-plumes, mantle, back, wing-coverts, and some of the inner
secondaries bright metallic green, blue, or bronze-red changing
with the light; primaries and outer secondaries black, more or less
edged with blue; tail and its coverts pure white; abdomen, flanks,
and thighs blue-black with more or less metallic green. Wing, 250;
tail, 82; culmen from base, 24; tarsus, 40.

"Female.--Similar to the male but smaller, narrow feathers of the
neck shorter, and also frontal knob smaller.

"Young.--Like the female, but the tail greenish black." (Salvadori.)

"Rare in all the islands visited by us except Tawi Tawi, where it is
very common. Invariably found on the ground in deep woods. It rises
very heavily and with much noise, always alighting in low trees,
and then flying from tree to tree if disturbed. Iris dark brown; legs
dark purple; upper surface of feet dark purple; lower surface yellow;
nails yellow; bill black. Seven specimens average as follows: Length,
346; culmen, 23; wing, 241; tail, 86; tarsus, 38; middle toe and claw,

Order RALLIFORMES.

RAILS, GALLINULES, AND COOTS.

Size medium to small; body compressed; thighs very muscular; legs
rather long; toes long; wing short and rounded; tail short and soft,
composed of ten or twelve feathers; bill strong but variable in form;
long and slightly curved in typical rails, short and thick in the
crakes, subconical and heavy in Porphyrio; nostrils pervious and
variable in shape; wing usually bearing a short spine or a flattened
knob. Most of the species inhabit marsh-land, rice-fields, or thick
beds of reeds bordering ponds and streams; Rallina, Amaurornis, and
Gallicrex are often found in dry fields or underbrush at considerable
distances from water. The nest is placed on the ground and well
concealed among reeds or bunches of grass; usually situated near water
or marshy ground. The eggs vary in number from four to ten, and are
usually much spotted and streaked. The downy young are coal-black.

"A common bird, snared in abundance by the natives. Two sets of eggs
were obtained by us in Siquijor. The nest was in each case placed on a
slight elevation, and was a mere heap of dried leaves and grasses. The
ground-color of the eggs is rather a rich creamy buff. They are
heavily blotched and spotted with a rich light chocolate-brown, the
blotches being more numerous at the larger end, where they are often
confluent. A few inconspicuous lilac markings are also present. The
eggs measure from 40.6 to 43 in length, and from 29 to 32 in greatest
breadth." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Oates describes two eggs collected in Siquijor in February by the
Steere Expedition. "The eggs of the Philippine crake are of a broad
oval form, and they have but little gloss. The ground is creamy white,
and this is spotted, streaked, and blotched, more thickly at the
larger end than elsewhere, with reddish brown and underlying pale
purple. Two examples measure respectively 41.9 by 30.9; 39.3 by 28.7."

A nest of this species found at Balete, Mindoro, was well hidden
in a clump of saw-grass. It was very weakly made of dry grass and
had a deep cup. The single egg was heavily incubated when taken on
May 20. It measures 41.6 by 30.9 mm. The ground-color is pale creamy
white. Small spots and fine dots of reddish brown are scattered over
the whole shell, but more numerously on the larger end where there
are also two large blotches of lavender. A few small lavender dots
are scattered over the entire surface.

legs olive-green, the broad scaling on the fore part of the tarsus,
and the scales of the upper part of the toes, lemon-yellow; joint
of heel dusky olive-green, with a shade of lemon-yellow immediately
below the garter, which is dark lake-red; iris reddish." (Sharpe.) Two
males from Bohol measure: Wing, 157, 162; tail, 70, 73; bill from

"The eggs of the moorhen are normally of a broad oval form and have
a small amount of gloss. The ground-color varies much, being creamy
white, pale greenish white, pale buff or pinkish buff. The markings
consist of specks, spots, and bold blotches of deep reddish brown, and
a few underlying pale purple spots. The combinations in which these
markings occur are numerous. In some, the markings are all small and
densely set over the shell; in others, spots are combined with huge
blotches which are often confluent. As a rule the larger end of the
egg is more thickly marked than the other parts. A few specimens are
devoid of all markings except some pale purple blotches. Examples vary
from 39.3 to 55 in length and from 27.9 to 36 in breadth." (Oates.)

Four eggs collected by Whitehead in Samar, August 25, 1896, are
thus described: "The eggs are perfectly similar to those laid by
European moorhens, but the number of eggs in the clutch, as well
as their relatively smaller size, is noteworthy. Measurements 42 by
39." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"According to Oates, the male in winter has the fleshy process on
the head reduced in size or nearly obsolete.

"Adult female.--General color above dark brown with a slight ashy
shade, the feathers with sandy buff margins, so that the upper
surface appears streaked; lower back and rump rather more uniform;
wing-coverts ashy gray, the greater series browner, with fulvous
margins like the inner secondaries, which have dusky frecklings also
on the outer web; alula ashy brown, the outer feathers edged with
white; primary-coverts and quills brown, externally shaded with ashy;
first primary white along the outer web; tail-feathers dark brown,
edged with lighter brown; crown uniform dark brown, forming a cap;
hind neck like the back; lores, eyebrow, sides of face, and sides of
neck dark sandy buff; throat and center of the abdomen white; remainder
of under surface from the lower throat downwards pale isabelline buff,
crossed with narrow wavy bars of dusky brown; lower flanks rather more

"Young.--Resembles the old female, but much more tawny everywhere,
especially on the sides of face, neck, and under parts, the latter
being much more narrowly and indistinctly barred with dusky brown
than in the adult birds." (Sharpe.)

"A male and female adult from Catanduanes in the brownish buff plumage
of autumn and winter. Neither Dr. Sharpe, in his Catalogue, nor any
other author, so far as I am aware, makes the slightest reference
to the autumn change of plumage which is so marked in the male,
only the breeding dress being described, in which the whole of the
hind neck and under parts, as well as the general color of the upper
parts, are black. In the fully adult male before me the whole of the
under parts from the throat downward are pale buff with rather fine,
somewhat wavy, brownish black bars, except on the middle of the belly,
which is paler and nearly devoid of markings; the under tail-coverts
have the ground-color more rufous-buff; the rest of the plumage also
resembles that of the female. The latter does not appear to have any
different breeding plumage, or, if she changes, the feathers are very
similar to those of the autumn dress." (Grant.)

"Abundant about paddy-fields in some localities. It nests on the ground
in these fields, and the natives found a number of nests for us while
cutting rice. They call the bird tug-túg from its note." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

In an adult male from Sibuyan, June 7, 1904, the head and mantle are
light slate-gray with dark centers to the feathers and the lower parts

In an adult male from Guindulman, Bohol, June 3, 1906, the head,
face, and lower parts are largely black and except on top of head,
the greater number of the feathers are fringed with pale buff or
white. Length, 419; wing, 235; tail, 87; bill from gape, 36; bill
from nostril, 19; tarsus, 77; middle toe with claw, 94.

curved; angle of lower mandible distinct. ... Larinæ (p. 95)



Subfamily STERNINÆ.

The members of this subfamily afford no very tangible characters
to distinguish them from the gulls other than those already
mentioned. However, the terns are, as a rule, of more slender form
and more airy and graceful flight. The wings, bill, and tail are
proportionately longer and the body smaller than these parts in
the gulls.



Genera.


a1. Tail more or less forked.

  b1. Tail but little more than one-third of wing, its outer feathers
  broad and rounded. ... Hydrochelidon (p. 86)
  b2. Tail much more than one-third of wing, its outer feathers narrow
  and pointed. ... Sterna (p. 88)

a2. Tail graduated; plumage sooty brown. ... Anous (p. 94)



Genus HYDROCHELIDON Boie, 1822.

Bill short and slender; legs and feet small; webs between the toes
deeply emarginate; wings long, when closed, exceeding the tail;
tail short, nearly square.

a1. Black or dark gray below (adults in summer).

  b1. Upper tail-coverts and tail white; under wing-coverts
  black. ... leucoptera (p. 86)

    Europe to central Asia and China; Australia, New Zealand, Africa
    in winter.


"Adult in breeding plumage.--Head, neck, and upper back dark, glossy
black; coverts on the carpal joint pure white; greater wing-coverts
pearl-gray; secondaries darker, passing into slate-gray; primaries
frosted with pearl-gray, which soon wears off the outer quills,
leaving the webs sooty black, with a well-defined narrow whitish
streak down the middle of the inner webs of the four outer primaries;
shafts white; back and rump grayish black; upper tail-coverts and
tail pure white; under parts deep black; vent white; flanks, under

"Adult in autumn and winter plumage.--In the latter part of July,
when the molt begins (in Europe), the bird is curiously parti-colored,
the new feathers of the head, neck, and under parts being white and
those of the back gray (paler than in Hydrochelidon nigra). Later,
the under parts, including the under wing-coverts and axillars,
become white, the crown and nape being merely mottled with black;
but by the following April the black color has reappeared to a
considerable extent, especially in the axillars.

"Immature.--In birds which are not mature, though capable of breeding,
the black of the under parts has a brownish tinge and the tail-feathers
are pearl-gray, especially toward the tips. In winter like the adult.

"Young.--Similar to the winter plumage of the somewhat immature
bird, but much mottled with dark brown on the upper parts, and the
tail-feathers slightly darker gray with a brownish tinge toward the
tips; upper tail-coverts always white.

"Nestling.--Ruddy fawn-color, mottled with black above, unspotted
pale cinnamon-brown below." (Saunders.)

"Observed and shot by us in Mindanao, where it was flying over the
rice-fields." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

a distinctly darker hue both above and below than northern examples;
Australian specimens, on the other hand, are inclined to be paler.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, or a trifle paler in general tint.

"Adult in winter plumage.--Upper parts of a paler gray than in the
breeding season; forehead white; crown and nape streaked and mottled
with black; under parts entirely white; bill and feet reddish brown.

"Young in first plumage.--Crown and nape blackish brown, mantle mottled
with brown and with warm cinnamon-brown edges to inner secondaries;

"Coloration.--Similar to that of S. fluviatilis [= hirundo], except
that the bill is always black and the feet are blackish. Adults are
darker in color, both above and below, but the difference is not
great. All the measurements appear identical, or nearly so, except
those of the bill, which is altogether smaller, and measures about
45 mm. from the gape." (Blanford.)

"Adult in winter.--Forehead flecked with white otherwise similar.

"Immature.--Like that of fluviatilis [= hirundo] from which it
can hardly be distinguished except by the color of the bill and
feet and the somewhat smaller size and more delicate shape of the
latter." (Saunders.)

"Adult male in full breeding plumage (type).--Forehead, cheeks,
lores, ear-coverts, neck all round, and whole under parts, including
lining of wing and bend of wing, pure white; crown and long occipital
crest glossy black; mantle, wings, rump, upper tail-coverts, and
upper surface of middle rectrices dark smoke-gray, darkest on wings
and middle of back, where the color is almost mouse-gray; primary
quills white; first primary with outer web, a band along quill on
inner web and tip blackish, with a silvery suffusion which is most
marked toward center of feather; broad outer margin of inner web,
below the black tip, white; second primary similar but black tip
deeper in color and extending a short distance down outer margin of
inner web, thus inclosing the white of inner web for a short distance;
third, fourth, and fifth primaries like second, but black tip gradually
growing deeper in color; outer rectrices above pale smoke-gray at tips
and along shafts, pale grayish white toward base; second and third
rectrices darker on the outer webs and at tip and whitish toward base
of inner webs. Bill in dried specimen, dull yellow clouded with olive

28; culmen, 62." (Bangs.)

"Very common throughout the group, especially abundant about the
native fish-pens." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

This is much the largest tern found in the Philippines. Rather local
in its distribution but usually found not far from fish-corrals or
where schools of small fishes appear near the surface of the water.

Philippine records of this species are usually recorded under Sterna
bergii, but the specimens probably belong to the variety S. bergii
boreotis. The question can not be cleared up at present.

and a blackish edge to the inner margin; second quill similar, but with
merely a short hairline of black on the outer web; third quill with
a trifle more black running upward from the black tip along the outer
web; fourth quill similar, but with a gray center to inner web; fifth
quill white on both webs, and with a minute white tip; sixth similar,
but the tip gray and broader, so that the black becomes a subterminal
bar; seventh similar, but with less and fainter black; upper primaries
gray; secondaries paler gray, without conspicuous margins. Bill,
tarsi, and toes lake-red; iris hazel. Length, 394 to 406; culmen,
46; wing, 298 to 305; tail, 127; tarsus, 43; middle toe with claw, 39.

"The female is undoubtedly smaller as a rule, though there are
exceptions.

"Adult in winter.--Similar, but without a hood; merely a little
grayish on the occiput, and blackish on the auriculars. In vigorous
birds the indications of a hood reappear in autumn, soon after the
completion of the molt, which is in August; but cold weather, combined
with a scarcity of nutritive food, arrests the development, and it
is not usual to see birds with fully complete hoods till February,
though there are many exceptions. A female (by dissection) obtained
in the shore-nets at Wells, Norfolk, on November 10, has the under
parts, and even the shafts and webs of the primaries, suffused with
a beautiful salmon-pink, but this also must be considered unusual.

"Nestling.--Buffish to brown, darkest on the upper parts, spotted
and streaked with umber and black on the back, head, and throat.

"Young.--Forehead white, rest of head chiefly grayish brown; upper
surface warmer brown, with gray lower wing-coverts; secondaries with
blackish centers and white borders; the three outer primaries black
on outer webs and at the tips and margins of inner webs, but the
centers white, except the outermost, in which there is for a time
a dark line inside the shaft; in the succeeding primaries the dark
color increases ascendingly on the inner webs, while from the fifth
the outer webs are pale gray to brownish, with a little white at tips;
tail-feathers white, with a band of blackish brown; under surface dull
white. Bill dull yellow, passing into black at the angles; tarsi and
toes dull reddish yellow. The brown color is soon lost on the back,
which has become gray by December.

"Immature.--Like the adult, with a few brown markings left on the upper
wing-coverts, and more black on the outer webs of the primaries. More
or less of a brown hood is assumed when the bird is barely a year old,
and the band on the tail is lost by the following autumn, when the new
primaries appear, with, as has been said, a larger proportion of black
than in the adult; in fact the duration of the immature phase is very
short. The bird does not breed until the following, or second spring.

"Occasionally the black from the margins of the inner webs of the
three outer quills runs in and reaches the shafts, much encroaching
upon the usual white centers, though not to the same extent on both
wings of the same bird. This is noticeable in two examples obtained
at Dinapur in December." (Saunders.)

This small gull is often abundant about Manila Bay but does not remain
throughout the year.

    Luzon (Schmacker). Bering Sea and Arctic Siberia; Chinese coasts,
    Japan, Formosa, and Bonin Islands in winter.


Adult male in breeding plumage.--Head, neck, tail, and under parts
white; mantle and wing surface french-gray, with broad white tips
to the scapulars and secondaries, making a conspicuous alar bar;
all the primaries tipped with white; outermost quill blackish from
the base downward (save a narrow gray wedge on inner web), with
a white tip 63 mm. in length in mature birds, and a narrow, black
bar which divides the white into tip and "mirror" in the majority;
second quill blackish for about 10 mm. on both sides of shaft, with a
black subterminal bar, a white mirror, and, on the inner web, a broad,
gray wedge which sometimes breaks through and joins the mirror; third
quill grayish basally, blackish on the lower part of outer web and on
the subterminal bar, gray on the inner web, passing into white at the
apex of the wedge; fourth similar but gray on both webs above the bar;
fifth quill similar but bar narrower; sixth gray, without a bar in
mature birds and with a narrow bar in others; the remaining quills
gray with white tips. In less mature birds there is no mirror on
the second quill. Ring around eye and gape bright orange-red; tarsi
and toes pale flesh-color. Length, about 610; wing, 457; tail, 197;
culmen, 74; tarsus, 70; middle toe with claw, 66.

The female is smaller and less robust.

Adult in winter.--Similar but head and neck streaked with ash-brown.

Immature and young.--In the first autumn the upper parts are streaked
and mottled with brown and grayish buff; quills dark umber, with
paler inner webs and whitish tips to most; rectrices similar, but
more or less mottled with whitish at bases of two or three outer
pairs; feathers of upper tail-coverts brown, with buffish white tips;
under parts nearly uniform brown at first, but afterwards brownish
gray, mottled; bill blackish, paler at base of lower mandible. The
second autumn the head is nearly white, streaked with grayish brown;
the upper parts are barred with brown on a grayish ground, though
no pure gray feathers have yet made their appearance on mantle;
quills paler; tail more mottled with white at the bases of all the
feathers. In the third autumn the feathers of the mantle are chiefly
gray, with some brownish streaks down the shafts; a faint subapical
spot begins to show on the outermost primary; the tail-coverts are
partly white, and the dark portion of the rectrices is much broken up;
under parts nearly white. In the fourth autumn the subapical patch
on first primary is larger, and the quills from the fifth upward
are banded with black and tipped with white; tail-feathers white,
slightly vermiculated with brown; bill greenish yellow basally,
reddish black at the angle. At the molt of the fifth autumn all
brown markings are lost, the primaries have white tips, black bars,
and gray wedges, though the proportion of dark coloring in quills is
greater than it is in older birds. (Compiled from Saunders.)

The only notice of the occurrence of the Vega gull in the Philippine
Islands, appears to be the record by Hartlaub.

    northern latitudes.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Above black, mixed with chestnut or
partly chestnut feathers on center of mantle; scapulars for the most
part chestnut, but outer ones black at the ends or irregularly marked
with black; accessory scapular plumes white; back and rump pure white;
upper tail-coverts black, longer ones pure white; lesser wing-coverts
blackish; innermost rather broadly edged with white, as also those
near edge of wing; median coverts for the most part chestnut, slightly
mottled with black; greater coverts blackish, narrowly margined and
broadly tipped with white; alula and primary-coverts black, innermost
of the latter with white tips; quills black with white shafts, and
white bases to the inner primaries; secondaries for the most part
white, blackish toward the ends of the feathers, these black markings
decreasing gradually toward the inner secondaries, some of which are
pure white, the innermost secondaries black, mottled with chestnut,
like the scapulars; tail-feathers black with white bases, all but the
center tail-feathers tipped with white, the black diminishing in size
and forming a band toward the outer feathers, which are almost white;
crown and hind neck white, the former streaked, the latter mottled
with black; base of forehead and a narrow frontal line black, followed
by a band of white, which unites with a broad eyebrow and is extended
over ear-coverts; lores and fore part of cheeks white; feathers round
eye and eyelid white, separated from the white loral patch by a narrow
line of black, which unites the frontal band to a square, black patch
beneath the eye, the latter joined to a malar line of black, which
is connected with the sides of the neck and with the fore neck and
sides of breast, all these parts being black, but nearly divided by
a semi-lunar band of white, which reaches from the sides of the neck
almost to the breast; throat and under surface of body from the center
of chest downward, white; under wing-coverts and axillars pure white;
quills below ashy whitish along the inner web. 'Bill black; feet deep
orange-red, claws black; iris hazel.' (Audubon.) Length, 200; culmen,
23; wing, 157; tail, 58; tarsus, 24; middle toe with claw, 28.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Much duller than the male,
and having the same pattern of black and white about the face,
but never developing the same amount of chestnut about the back,
the head and hind neck being brown, mottled with blackish centers to
the feathers. Length, 216; culmen, 23; wing, 160; tail, 62; tarsus,
24; middle toe with claw, 25.

"Young.--Above dusky brown, all the feathers edged with sandy
buff or rufous; wings and tail as in the adult; crown dark brown,
streaked with sandy buff, the margins of the feathers being of this
color; tail-feathers white, with a broad, subterminal band of black,
decreasing in extent toward the outermost feathers, all the feathers
tipped with sandy buff; throat and under surface white; lower throat,
fore neck, sides of neck, and sides of breast, mottled with dusky
blackish centers to the feathers, marking the black pattern of the
adults, even the semi-lunar neck-band of the adults being indicated
by a broad, crescentic band of sandy buff in the young.

"Winter plumage of the adult.--Above nearly uniform dusky brown, but
not showing the tawny rufous margins to feathers of upper surface, the
edges being ashy brown; head uniform brown like the back; hind neck and
sides of neck ashy, mottled with dusky centers to the feathers; sides
of face brown, with more or less white on ear-coverts; black markings
on cheeks and throat as in the breeding bird, but the white semi-lunar
band on the sides of the neck replaced by a patch of light brown.

"The difference between the winter plumage of the adult and the first
full plumage of the young birds consists in the sandy buff margins
to the feathers of the upper surface, which are very distinct in
the latter at first. Afterwards they become abraded, and then there
is scarcely any distinguishing mark between the winter plumages of
the adult and young. In the spring the red plumage is very rapidly
acquired, and I believe that it is gained quite as much by the change
in the pattern of the feathers as by a direct molt." (Sharpe.)

"Often seen in small flocks during the winter months." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

Not uncommon on tide-flats in the winter months; it is easily
recognized by its bright red legs.



Subfamily LOBIVANELLINÆ.

Genus MICROSARCOPS Sharpe, 1896.

A hard round knob at bend of wing; a small fleshy wattle on each side
of head at base of bill; bill plover-like with a decided swelling at
the tip; nostril linear in a groove; wing pointed, first and second
primaries equal and largest; tarsus long, covered with large hexagonal
scales which appear as transverse plates in front; front toes webbed
at base; hind toe small.

"Adult male.--Above light brown, with a slight bronzy gloss; rump,
upper tail-coverts, and base of tail white; terminal third of tail
black, forming a broad band, tips white with a slight subterminal
shade of brown, the black band vanishing toward the outer tail-feather,
which is entirely white; wing-coverts brown like the back, but a little
paler; median coverts with narrow white tips, except the outer ones,
which are pure white; greater coverts nearly entirely white, with
brown at the extreme base, increasing in extent on the inner ones;
alula dark brown; primary-coverts and quills black; secondaries
pure white; outer ones dusky near the ends, inner ones externally

edges of eyelids and lappets deep yellow.' (Oates.) Length, 355;
culmen, 35; wing, 239; tail, 102; tarsus, 67.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male in plumage. Length, 368; culmen,
35; wing, 239; tail, 107; tarsus, 68.

"Adult in winter.--Differs from the summer plumage in having the gray
of head and throat washed with brown, especially on the chest; the
black band obscured by ashy or whitish tips to the feathers." (Sharpe.)

Young male in winter.--Upper parts brown with a slight gloss, the
feathers with dusky shafts; forehead and neck a trifle lighter
and grayer; upper tail-coverts and tail white, rectrices with a
subterminal, blackish band which is widest on central pair and absent
from outermost pair; chin whitish; throat, and sides of head and
neck, light brown with whitish streaks; breast brown, rest of under
parts white; wing-coverts brown like the back but a little paler,
median coverts with narrow white tips, except the outer ones which
are pure white; greater coverts nearly entirely white, with brown at
extreme base, increasing in extent on inner ones; alula dark brown;
primary-coverts and quills black; secondaries white, the inner ones
externally light brown and the innermost brown like the back.

This lapwing resembles a large plover, but is distinguished by
having a small hind toe, a short and blunt wing-spur, and a small,
fleshy wattle or lappet between the eye and the base of bill. The
only Philippine specimen known was taken near Manila in January, 1906.



Subfamily CHARADRIINÆ.

    Cape of Good Hope, and South America.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Above mottled with bars of black
and ashy white, the feathers being black, notched with white and
broadly tipped with the latter; scapulars and wing-coverts like
back, the greater series edged externally with white, inner ones
distinctly notched with white; alula and primary-coverts black,
the former slightly, the latter more plainly, tipped with white;
quills black, the shaft white about the middle; first two primaries
white for the greater portion of the inner web, decreasing in extent
on the succeeding quills, which also have the median portion of
the shaft white, but after the fourth this white shaft accompanied
by an increasing amount of white on outer web; secondaries brown,
with white edges and tips, bases of inner webs also white; innermost
secondaries resembling the back, and notched with ashy brown and
blackish; lower back and rump dusky brown, with white spots and
fringes to the feathers; upper tail-coverts and tail white, barred
with black or blackish brown, the bars decreasing toward the outer
feathers, where they are broken up into spots on the outer web;
crown like the back, but more minutely mottled and more hoary white;
forehead and a broad eyebrow white, extending down sides of neck,
and forming a large patch on sides of upper breast; lores, sides of
face, ear-coverts, and under surface black, excepting abdomen and
under tail-coverts, which are pure white; thighs white, streaked
with black; under wing-coverts white; axillars black, with slightly
indicated fringes of brown at tips; quills below dusky, with white
on inner webs; lower primary-coverts pale ashy. 'Bill, legs, feet,
and claws black; iris dark hazel.' (Seebohm.) Length, 267; culmen,
33; wing, 206; tail, 74; tarsus, 46.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Above, not so strongly mottled
with black as the male, and consequently rather browner, especially
on the head; black of face and under parts not so much developed,
these parts being mottled with irregular black markings. Length, 279;
culmen, 33; wing, 203; tail, 74; tarsus, 46.

"Adult in winter plumage.--Differs from the summer plumage chiefly
in wanting the black on face and breast, but, from the absence of
black mottling on the back, the whole upper surface appears more
uniform, being ashy brown with narrow whitish edgings to the feathers,
before which is a blackish subterminal shade; lores white, but base
of forehead like crown; a line of white above and below eye, but
the white eyebrow scarcely visible above the ear-coverts, which are
dingy blackish; sides of face white, streaked with dusky; throat and
under parts pure white, lower throat and fore neck pale ashy brown,
slightly mottled with dusky markings; under wing-coverts white,
except the lower primary-coverts, which are dusky ashy; axillars black.

"Young.--Like the winter plumage of the adults, and always to be
distinguished from the golden plover by the black axillars, though it
is spangled with golden buff on the upper surface, as is the latter
species." (Sharpe.)

The gray plover, known as the black-bellied plover in the United
States, is found along the seashore in small numbers during the winter
months. As seen in the Philippines it is usually in the gray plumage
but as with its very near relative, the golden plover, individuals
having the breast mottled with black are not uncommon.

"Male and female in summer.--Forehead white, continued back over each
eye as a broad supercilium and extending down the sides of neck;
whole upper plumage black, each feather with large marginal yellow
spots on both webs, the spots on the wing-coverts tending to white;
primary-coverts and the greater series brown, tipped and margined with
white; primaries brown, the central portion of the shaft whitish;
secondaries brown tipped with whitish; tail blackish, irregularly
barred with white; chin, throat, fore neck, breast, and abdomen black;

axillars smoky brown with white tips.

"Male and female in winter.--Upper plumage black, the feathers margined
with yellow; wing-coverts margined with dull white; quills and tail
much as in summer; forehead and sides of head fulvous, the latter part
streaked with brown; chin and upper throat fulvous-white; lower throat,
fore neck, and feathers under cheeks and ear-coverts rather bright
fulvous with minute streaks of brown; breast grayish, the feathers
broadly margined with fulvous; remainder of lower plumage pale buffy
white; sides of body more or less marked and fringed with fulvous;

iris dark hazel-brown; legs plumbeous; claws horn-color. Length, 254;
tail, 63; wing, 160; tarsus, 46; bill from gape, 28. The sexes are
of about the same size.

"The golden plover frequents waste ground, grassy plains, and wet
paddy-fields, and also the edges of rivers, and is generally met with
in flocks of considerable size. It breeds in China, and also it is
said in some parts of India, laying four eggs in a hollow lined with
a few blades of grass. The eggs are yellowish blotched with blackish
sepia." (Oates.)

The Eastern golden plover is found in the Philippines on migration
and is then usually in its gray winter dress but specimens have been
taken with numbers of black feathers from the summer plumage.



Genus OCHTHODROMUS Reichenbach, 1852.

    and Hainan, south in winter to Africa, India, and Australia.


"Adult in breeding plumage.--Above light brown, with a slight
olive-greenish gloss, wing-coverts like the back, with obsolete
indications of paler fringes to some of the feathers, greater series
tipped with white, forming a narrow wing-bar; alula, primary-coverts,
and quills brown, primaries darker brown along their outer webs and
at tips, shafts white; inner primaries with a white mark toward the
base of outer web; secondaries brown, with white fringes to the end
of outer web and white tips, shafts white, with a little extension
along the sides of the shaft in the inner secondaries; innermost
long secondaries like back, outer ones white along their outer web;
rump and upper tail-coverts a little lighter and more ashy brown than
the back, with white fringes to most of the feathers; sides of rump
white; tail ashy brown with a broad white tip, a subterminal shade of
darker brown, forming an obsolete, subterminal band; outer feathers
with more or less white near base of inner web, outermost one almost
entirely white, except for a slight shade of smoky brown and a slightly
indicated subterminal shade of darker brown; hinder crown light brown,
entirely surrounded by pale cinnamon-rufous, which occupies fore part
of crown and extends down sides of neck round hinder neck, where
it forms a broad collar of pale cinnamon-rufous; base of forehead
white, followed by a narrow black band; lores black; feathers in
front of and below the eye black; which unite with a black band along
top of ear-coverts; sides of face and under surface of body white;
across fore neck and chest a broad band of cinnamon-rufous or light
chestnut, which extends a little way down the sides of upper breast;
under wing-coverts, axillars, and quill-lining white. Length, 215;
culmen, 25; wing, 140; tail, 51; tarsus, 37.

"Adult in winter plumage.--Differs from the summer plumage in wanting
the rufous chest and in the absence of all facial markings. Above
uniform brown, head like the back, hind neck paler and more ashy
brown; lores, forehead, eyelid, and a broad eyebrow white; feathers
below eye brown extending in a streak along ear-coverts; cheeks and
entire under surface white, with a patch of brown on each side of
upper breast. 'Bill black; tarsus greenish gray or pale olive; toes
dusky or blackish; iris brown.' (Hume.)

"Young.--Similar to the adults in winter plumage, but dark brown,
with faint edges of sandy buff to the feathers of upper surface;
eyebrow and sides of face washed with sandy rufous, a strong shade
of which color pervades chest and sides of upper breast." (Sharpe.)

In winter plumage Ochthodromus geoffroyi and O. mongolus are very
similar but the former may be recognized by its larger size and longer
bill. In a male the wing measures 136; tail, 57; exposed culmen, 24;
tarsus, 36; middle toe with claw, 24. Wing of a female, 140; tail,
55; exposed culmen, 24; tarsus, 37; middle toe with claw, 23.

    (1906), 23.

    Mindanao (Mearns); Mindoro (Porter); Negros (Bourns & Worcester);
    Palawan (Platen, Whitehead); Ticao (McGregor). Northern Asia,
    south in winter to China, Malay Archipelago, and Australia.


"Adult in breeding plumage.--Similar to O. geoffroyi, but smaller,
bill and tarsus much shorter; a broader black line along sides
of face; ear-coverts entirely black; the white throat separated
from the rufous chest-band by a narrowly indicated line of
black. 'Bill black; feet somewhat bluish black, toes darker; iris
dark brown.' (Stejneger.) Length, 190; culmen, 19; wing, 127; tail,
53; tarsus, 30.

"Adult female in summer plumage.--Similar to the male, but less richly
colored; rufous chest-band never so pronounced; facial markings less
developed, the black bands on the forehead often obsolete. 'Bill
black; feet dark gray, with an olive tinge; toes darker, blackish;
iris dark hazel.' (Stejneger.) Length, 178; culmen, 20; wing, 140;
tail; 47; tarsus, 30.

"Adult in winter plumage.--Differs from the summer plumage in wanting
the facial markings and the rufous chest. Very similar to the winter
plumage of O. geoffroyi, and distinguished chiefly by its smaller
size, shorter bill, and shorter tarsus; there is also a little more
brown on the ear-coverts.

"Young.--Similar to the adults in winter plumage, but darker brown,
all the feathers edged with sandy brown; eyebrow, sides of face,
and under surface of body with a strong tint of sandy buff. 'Bill,
angle of mouth, and ring round eyes black; legs clear gray; tarsus
tinged with yellowish, toes with blackish, and soles with reddish;
iris dark brown.' (Stejneger.)

"The exact method by which the rufous chest of the summer plumage is
gained is not easy to discover. In some specimens in winter dress there
is a distinct narrow line of brown across the fore neck; in most of the
series of skins in the Museum this is wanting, as it is also in young
birds. It may therefore be a sign of very old birds only, as there are
traces of brown feathers in an old bird which has not quite attained
its full summer plumage. In the specimen in question it is also evident
that the rufous breast is being acquired by a change of color in the
feather, from brown to rufous, as well as by a molt. Probably only
very old birds go through this double process, as in the majority of
specimens the rufous breast appears to be gained by a molt only. When
first developed all the rufous feathers are edged with white.

"A young bird is described by Dr. Stejneger as somewhat resembling
the adult: 'The brownish gray of the back is paler, and each feather
narrowly edged with isabella-color, with which also the lower parts
are suffused. On the pectoral region a buffish tinge replaces the
rufous collar, and the black markings are absent from the head, the
cheeks and ear-coverts being slightly dusky; the forehead between
the bill and the eyes whitish, suffused with isabella-color.'

"The winter plumage and young livery of the western and eastern
forms of O. mongolus are, as might have been expected, very difficult
to distinguish, but the western form seems always to have a longer
tarsus (about 32 mm.), whereas the eastern form has the tarsus about
28 mm." (Sharpe.)

    (1906), 23.

    Palawan (Platen, Bourns & Worcester, White). Mongolia and China,
    in winter to the Moluccas and Australia.


"Adult in summer plumage.--Similar to O. geoffroyi, but with a longer
and more slender bill, and distinguished by its smoky brown axillars,
under wing-coverts, and quill-linings. Upper parts uniform brown,
with slightly indicated rufous edgings to many of the feathers;
alula, primary-coverts, and quills dark brown, first primary only
having a white shaft, and no white present on inner webs of quills;
secondaries uniform dark brown, with an obsolete white fringe to the
tips; innermost secondaries like back; tail-feathers brown, with white
tips and a subterminal shade of darker brown, outer feather white
along outer web; crown brown like back, slightly washed with rufous,
as also the hind neck, where, however, there is no distinct collar
as in O. geoffroyi; forehead white to middle of eye; eyebrow, sides
of face, and throat white; lower throat, fore neck, and chest bright
chestnut, extending down the sides of the upper breast and followed
by a horseshoe mark of black; breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts
pure white; under wing-coverts and axillars dark smoky brown, with
ashy whitish tips; quill-lining also dark smoky brown. 'Bill deep
olive-brown, blacker on the terminal portion; feet light brownish
flesh-color; toes washed with gray, blackish on joints; claws black;
eyelids grayish black.' (Swinhoe.) Length, 215; culmen, 25; wing,
165; tail, 61; tarsus, 44.

"Adult in winter plumage.--Differs from the summer plumage in wanting
the rufous chest-band. Above dark brown, including crown; forehead
and eyebrow isabelline white, hinder part of the latter shaded with
sandy buff, which color also pervades the sides of face and of neck,
and forms a faint collar round hind neck; throat isabelline white;
lower throat, fore neck, and chest pale brown; remainder of under
surface white; under wing-coverts, axillars, and quill-lining smoky
brown." (Sharpe.)



Genus ÆGIALITIS Boie, 1822.

This genus includes a number of small plovers not differing greatly
from Charadrius except in size and colors; the plumage is never spotted
and, with the exception of a more or less complete dusky band across
the chest, the lower parts are pure white.

"Adult male.--Above light brown, a little darker on rump and central
tail-coverts; sides of rump and lateral upper tail-coverts pure white;
wing-coverts like back; feathers round the bend of wing darker brown;
alula blackish with white tips; primary-coverts blackish; primary
quills blackish, internally lighter brown, with dark shafts to all
the primaries except the first, where it is white; secondaries dusky,
lighter and more ashy brown internally, inner secondaries smoky brown,
with a good deal of white on both webs, the long inner secondaries like
the back; tail ashy brown, tipped with white, and with a subterminal
black bar, outer feathers more distinctly edged with white, the two
outermost almost entirely white, with a black patch on inner web
corresponding to the subterminal bar on the rest of the feathers;
base of forehead, lores, feathers above and below eye, and ear-coverts
black; a broad frontal band of white, followed by another broad band of
black above the eye, which is again succeeded by another black line,
which widens out above the eye and forms a distinct eyebrow; hinder
crown as far as nape ashy brown; round the neck a broad white collar,
continuous with the white throat, and followed by a broad band of
black on lower hind neck, and continued across fore neck, widening out
on the sides; cheeks, throat, and under surface pure white, including
under wing-coverts and axillars. 'Bill dusky black; feet flesh-color;
iris dusky brown; ring round eye bright yellow.' (Emin.) Length, 173;
culmen, 15; wing, 117; tail, 60; tarsus, 25; middle toe with claw, 20.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, but with the markings not so well
developed, especially the black markings of the face and the black
bands on the hind neck and fore neck, the latter being much mixed
with brown. 'Bill black; feet pale flesh-color; iris dark brown;
ring round eye bright yellow.' (Hartert.) Length, 165; culmen, 16;
wing, 117; tail, 60; tarsus, 25.

"Young.--Differs from the adults in wanting the black on the head,
as well as the black collars on the mantle and fore neck; general
tone of the plumage more rufescent than in the adults, and the whole
of the upper surface varied with wavy lines of pale sandy buff,
before which is a subterminal dusky bar; forehead pale sandy buff;
ear-coverts dusky blackish; the collar on the fore neck composed of
brown feathers, with generally a tinge of sandy buff on the throat. The
black markings on the head and the black collars are gained by a molt
in the following spring. There appears to me to be also a change of
feathers especially on the neck collar." (Sharpe.)

This little plover was abundant along the Baco River in the vicinity of
Balete, Mindoro, where it nested on the extensive gravel-flats exposed
by low water. A nest found April 24, 1905, was a slight hollow, lined
with a mosaic of small pebbles. The three eggs measure 30.4 by 21.8;
28.9 by 21.8; 30.9 by 21.8. Their ground-color is very pale gray,
almost white, carrying a considerable number of small lilac-colored
spots. Small spots and irregularly shaped markings of dark brown
are scattered over the entire surface, but are more numerous on the
larger end.

"A resident species, usually met with about small fresh-water streams
in the interior." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Adult male.--Above light ashy brown, darker on rump and central
upper tail-coverts; sides of rump and lateral upper tail-coverts pure
white; wing-coverts like the back, with a band of dark sepia-brown
along marginal coverts; greater coverts broadly tipped with white;
alula and primary-coverts dark brown, with white tips, the shafts
conspicuously white; inner primaries white toward base of outer web;
secondaries dark brown, white at ends of outer web, increasing in
extent toward the innermost; long inner secondaries like the back;
four center tail-feathers dark brown, next pair smoky brown, next
pair white with a little smoky brown at the ends, remainder pure
white; crown rufous, with a nuchal collar of pure white, this collar
followed by a broad black band on hind neck overspreading mantle;
forehead white, reaching to above eye and separated from rufous of
crown by a tolerably broad band of black; a distinct loral streak of
black; sides of face and ear-coverts with a black band along upper
margin of the latter; cheeks and under surface pure white, with a
large black patch on each side of fore neck; under wing-coverts and
axillars white; quills below ashy gray. 'Bill black, orange at base;
feet gray, claws black; iris warm chocolate-brown; orbital ring pure
orange.' (Everett.) Length, about 150; culmen, 16; wing, 95; tail,
39; tarsus, 27; middle toe with claw, 20.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, but without the black band across
forehead; black on mantle and hind neck represented by dark brown mixed
with rufous; black patch at the side of fore neck replaced by dark
brown mixed with rufous, with a tinge of the latter color spreading
across fore neck. 'Bill black, base yellowish; feet purplish gray;
iris dark brown.' (Everett.) Length, 140; culmen, 16; wing, 102;
tail, 38; tarsus, 27.

"In some specimens, apparently very old males, the black band is
continued right across the fore neck.

"Young birds resemble the adults, but have no facial black markings
or any black or rufous on the mantle or sides of the chest, the whole
of the upper surface being uniform ashy brown, with broad sandy-buff
margins." (Sharpe.)

This little plover differs from Ægialitis dubia and Æ. alexandrina
in having a comparatively stout bill.

Whitehead took three eggs of the Malay sand-plover at Cape Engaño,
Luzon, on May 26, 1895. They are described as follows: "Shape
short ovate. Ground-color pale cream; the whole shell with small
blotches, streaks, and zigzag pencillings of rich sepia and pale
lavender. Measurements 30 mm. by 22 mm. The three eggs were deposited
on the bare sand among sea-drift and only a few yards above high-water
mark. The female was shot. On the same day young plovers nearly ready
to fly were captured." (Grant and Whitehead.)

    Cuyo (McGregor); Mindanao (Everett); Palawan (Whitehead, Platen,
    Everett, Steere Exp.); Panay (Steere Exp.); Siquijor (Steere Exp.);
    Ticao (McGregor). Europe and central Asia to China and Japan,
    in winter to Africa, Indian Peninsula, and Australia.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Above pale earthy brown, with faint
remains of paler margins to the feathers; wing-coverts like back,
marginal ones blackish brown, greater series darker brown with a narrow
white edging to the tip; alula and primary-coverts dark sepia-brown,
the latter fringed with white at the tip; quills sepia-brown, with
white shafts to the primaries, which are pale brown on inner web;
inner primaries for the most part white toward the base of outer web;
secondaries dusky brown with white tips, inner ones also white along
the margins of both webs, innermost long secondaries brown like back;
lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts dark sepia-brown, lateral ones
white, forming a patch on each side; the four center tail-feathers
dark sepia-brown, paler toward the base, and having white shafts to
the center ones, three outer feathers white, next ones smoky brown,
with white shafts; crown ashy brown, washed with light tawny-rufous,
especially distinct toward nape; hind neck and sides of neck white,
forming a collar; forehead and a distinct eyebrow white, with a
broad black band separating white of forehead from brown of crown;
eyelid and loral streak black; feathers below the eye and sides of
face white, with a black patch on hinder ear-coverts; cheeks and under
surface pure white, with a patch of black on each side of chest; under
wing-coverts and axillars white; quills below light ashy like the
lower primary-coverts. 'Bill black, with the base of lower mandible
of a dusky flesh-color; tarsi dusky, toes darker, claws black; iris
brown.' (Macgillivray.) Length, 165; culmen, 18; wing, 105; tail,
43; middle toe with claw, 18.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, but with less rufous on the head,
this being represented by a tinge over the eye and round the nape;
black band on the fore part of crown absent; black patch on each side
of the chest represented by a brown patch with a rufous tinge. Length,
165; culmen, 18; wing, 109; tail, 48; tarsus, 28.

"The Kentish plovers which attain their breeding plumage in the plains
of India are certainly much brighter in color than any which are
seen in Europe. The black forehead and patch at the side of the chest
are also strongly developed. Occasionally a rufous tinge overshades
the back.

"The adult bird in winter plumage differs from the summer plumage in
the entire absence of bright rufous on the head, and the black markings
on the face and sides of the breast are also not developed. The head
is like the back, the forehead and eyebrow are white, the lores dusky,
and there is always a more or less distinct white collar united to
the two sides of the neck.

"Young birds in first winter plumage only differ from the adults in
having the whole upper surface distinctly marked with pale edges to
the feathers." (Sharpe.)

This plover appears to be a winter visitant to the Philippines and
may be found in small flocks along the seashore wherever there are
tide-flats. It differs from both Æ. dubia and peroni in being slightly
larger and in having an incomplete band on the fore breast.



Subfamily HIMANTOPODINÆ.

Genus HIMANTOPUS Brisson, 1760.

Bill long, slender, straight, and pointed; wing long and slender,
reaching well beyond tip of tail, first primary much the longest; tail
short and square; legs extremely long and slender; bare portion of
tibia equal to three-fourths of tarsus, the latter two and one-half
times as long as middle toe with claw; toes webbed at base; hind
toe wanting.

its very long, slender, red legs. I observed a solitary individual
in Malamaui Island near Basilan and Celestino collected a number of
specimens in northern Mindanao.

    (Whitehead). India and Africa; Europe east to Lake Baikal, in
    winter to southern China and Malay Peninsula.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Above brown, with longitudinal
black centers to the feathers imparting a broadly striped appearance;
feathers of upper surface notched with ashy or rufous, giving to many
of the scapulars a somewhat barred appearance; wing-coverts dark brown,
edged with whity brown, median and greater series also checkered with
whity brown, imparting a somewhat barred appearance to this part of
the wing; alula, primary-coverts, and primaries blackish, externally
glossed with bottle-green; primary-coverts slightly tipped with white,
shafts of outer primaries white, those of inner ones brown, primaries
notched or barred, on inner web only, with sandy buff or whitish,
inner primaries thus marked on both webs; secondaries distinctly
barred with brown and white, both webs being deeply notched with ashy
whitish; innermost secondaries ashy brown with dusky brown cross-bars,
the center of the feathers being also dusky brown; lower back and
rump pure white with black longitudinal spots or streaks, a little
more distinct on the rump; upper tail-coverts barred with black and
white or with sagittate subterminal spots, the longer ones tinged with
sandy buff, giving a streaked appearance; neck more ashy, streaked
with brown; over the eye a white streak, narrowly lined with black;
sides of face and sides of neck, throat, and chest pale sandy buff
streaked with blackish brown, more narrowly on the sides of face;
chin and upper throat white; breast, abdomen, sides of body, thighs,
and under tail-coverts white, streaked with dark brown on breast, and
very narrowly on abdomen and under tail-coverts; thighs unstreaked;
sides of body with distinct bars or sagittate markings of dark brown;
under wing-coverts and axillars pure white, mottled with blackish
centers to the feathers; axillars more or less regularly barred with
blackish or with subterminal, heart-shaped spots; lower primary-coverts
and quills below ashy gray with white notches to the inner webs. 'Bill
fleshy brown, shading into dark brown toward the tip; feet dusky;
iris brown.' (Shelley.) Length, 533; culmen, 121; wing, 279; tail,
108; tarsus, 74.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Similar to the male, but larger,
and with a longer bill. Length, 610; culmen, 155; wing, 305; tail,
145; tarsus, 81.

"Adults in winter plumage.--Very similar to the breeding plumage,
but paler, and much less heavily striped, especially on the under
surface of the body; the black spots and streaks on the rump scarcely
apparent, and concealed by the white plumage; upper tail-coverts white,
with very few brown cross-bars; tail white, barred with brown. 'Feet
pale leaden gray, claws blackish; bill blackish brown, flesh-color
at the base of the lower mandible.' (Hume.)

"There is evidently a spring molt, but whether partial or entire I
have not been able to determine. The breeding plumage is gained by a
widening of the longitudinal centers to the feathers, of which the
pattern changes on several portions of the body. Such parts as the
rump and the abdomen and under tail-coverts have scarcely any visible
streaks, but these appear with the summer plumage and are gained by
a change of the feather. The sides of the body change from a streaked
to a barred appearance, this being effected by a preliminary widening
of the brown centers to the feathers which develop into bars without
any direct molt. The innermost secondaries, at the autumn molt, seem
to be entirely uniform, and the bars make their appearance gradually.

"Young.--Differs from the adult in being much more tawny, and, as
Seebohm has pointed out, young birds may always be distinguished
from the old ones by the much lighter patterns of the notches and
bars in the innermost secondaries, these markings being tawny buff,
and the black centers to the feathers being much broader." (Sharpe.)

This large curlew is extremely wary and although individuals are
occasionally seen on tide-flats, they are difficult to kill.



100. NUMENIUS CYANOPUS Vieillot.

ASIATIC CURLEW.


    Numenius cyanopus Vieillot, N. Dict. d'Hist. Nat. (1817), 8, 306;
    Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1896), 24, 350; Hand-List (1899),

    Bohol (McGregor); Cebu (McGregor); Negros (Steere Exp., Bourns &
    Worcester). Japan and eastern Siberia, in winter to Australia.


"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Similar to N. arquatus and of
the same size, but distinguished by the dark lower back and rump
and the regular barring of axillars and under wing-coverts. General
appearance more fulvous; under surface tinged with vinous-buff all
over; lower back and rump sandy buff with blackish brown centers to the
feathers, thus greatly resembling the rest of back; upper tail-coverts
barred with blackish brown and sandy buff or white. 'Bill black,
flesh-colored at base of lower mandible; feet bluish gray; iris dark
brown.' (Taczanowski.) Length, 610; culmen, 183; wing, 318; tail,
117; tarsus, 88.

"Adult male.--In this species the difference in size between the
sexes is not so apparent as in some of the allied ones. Length, 533;
culmen, 173; wing, 302; tail, 109; tarsus, 81.

"Young.--Much more tawny than the adults and having tawny-buff bars
or notches on the innermost secondaries; the streaks on the under
surface very fine and narrow.

"Adults in winter plumage do not differ very much from the summer
plumage, but the under surface is much less distinctly streaked;
the upper surface is very similar at both times of the year." (Sharpe.)

This curlew like the next preceding is a large bird and usually,
singly or in pairs, is found feeding on flats exposed at low tide.

    (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester); Ticao (McGregor) [14]. Japan
    and eastern Siberia, in winter southern China to Australia.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Above nearly uniform dark brown,
excepting for the broad, ashy brown markings on mantle and upper back;
wing-coverts like back, but margins paler and more whitish, greater
series with whitish notches on both webs; alula and primary-coverts
dark brown, fringed with white at the ends; primaries blackish brown,
notched with white on inner webs, which have a barred appearance along
the edge; inner primaries notched with white on both webs; secondaries
brown, notched on outer webs and barred on inner; innermost secondaries
nearly uniform with the back; shaft of outer primary white, of second
whity brown, and of the rest pale brown; lower back and rump white,
very thickly mottled with spots and bars of brown; upper tail-coverts
barred with brown and whitish, the brown bars somewhat irregular and
not coterminous; tail ashy brown, tipped with white, and crossed by
regular bars of dark brown, about nine in number; center of crown
whitish and streaked with brown, remainder of crown dark brown,
forming two broad bands and followed by a broad eyebrow of dull white
and narrowly streaked with small lines of blackish; lores and upper
margins of ear-coverts dark brown; remainder of sides of face and neck
pale brown, streaked with darker brown, cheeks somewhat whiter; chin
and upper throat white, with scarcely any brown spots; lower throat,
breast, and sides of body pale, rufescent buff, thickly clouded with
longitudinal streaks of dark brown on throat and breast; dark brown
bars of a more or less sagittate shape on sides of body and flanks;
abdomen and under tail-coverts white, the latter with streaks and
bars of dark brown; under wing-coverts and axillars white with broad
dusky brown bars, very distinct on the latter. 'Bill blackish, dark
brown at base of lower mandible; feet dark lead-color; claws black;
iris very dark brown.' (Taczanowski.) Length, 380; culmen, 76; wing,
223; tail, 96; tarsus, 55.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Similar to the male.

"Young birds may always be distinguished by the more mottled appearance
of upper surface, most of the feathers being spotted on both webs
with whitish or pale, rufescent buff; lower back and rump plentifully
mottled with spots of dusky brown, and innermost secondaries very
distinctly notched with rufescent buff; streaks on throat and breast
and bars on flanks almost as plentifully developed as in the adult;
bars on axillars often very incomplete, and, in rare instances, absent.

"The differences between this race and the whimbrel (N. phæopus)
of Europe are not so strongly pronounced in all cases as to render
the determination of specimens always a matter of certainty. Some
of the Philippine specimens, for instance, are very difficult to
separate from European examples, and many others also appear to be
intermediate between the two forms." (Sharpe.)

The above descriptions of the adult male and of the young are slightly
modified from Sharpe's descriptions of Numenius phæopus of which the
eastern whimbrel is but a subspecies.

The eastern whimbrel is much smaller than either of the two preceding
species and usually it may be killed with little trouble. In the
vicinity of tide-flats at high water it often congregates in flocks,
but as the feeding grounds become exposed the individuals scatter
to various parts following the receding tide. In length the male is
about 420; wing, 205; tail, 100; exposed culmen, 82; tarsus, 53;
middle toe with claw, 41. Wing of female, 240; tail, 110; exposed
culmen, 79; tarsus, 60.



Genus MESOSCOLOPAX Sharpe, 1896.

In structure this genus is similar to Numenius but the tarsus is
transversely scutellated both in front and behind.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Similar to the male, but not so
entirely cinnamon-rufous below, and with remains of brown bars on
the under surface, especially on the flanks. Length, 406; culmen,
109; wing, 240; tail, 82; tarsus, 58.

"Young.--The young birds may be told from the adults in winter plumage
by their more tawny color, and by the ashy gray shade on the throat and
chest, as well as by the fulvescent bars and notches to the feathers
of the upper surface." (Sharpe.)

Winter plumage.--Above ashy brown with rusty shaft-lines; back, rump,
and upper tail-coverts white with more or less hidden black arrow
marks of dark brown, these taking the form of bars on longest coverts;
below nearly pure white; slightly dusky on breast and with a few narrow

primaries blackish brown; wing-coverts and secondaries with broken,
dusky bars; primaries blackish brown; coverts and secondaries gray
with blackish shaft-lines and hoary edges.

Birds taken in the Philippines in the spring are in the white and gray
winter dress, but in the autumn (September) many individuals arrive in
nearly perfect breeding plumage, while others are in mixed plumage,
showing numerous light feathers among the dark and chestnut feathers
of the summer dress.

    Luzon (Celestino); Negros (Everett, Steere Exp.); Samar
    (Whitehead). Central and northern Europe to valley of Ob River;
    in winter Mediterranean countries and northeastern Africa.


"Adult male in winter plumage.--Above ashy brown, with slightly paler
edges to the feathers; lower back and rump blackish brown; upper
tail-coverts white, long ones tipped with black; lesser wing-coverts
darker brown than back; median coverts dusky brown, lighter brown
externally and fringed with white, forming a wing-band; alula blackish;
primary-coverts blackish, the inner ones broadly tipped with white;
primaries blackish, with white shafts, the greater part of the inner
webs white, and then subterminally brown, the white extending to the
base of the outer web on all but the first primary and increasing
in extent on the inner primaries and secondaries, the latter being
white with broad, blackish tips, which gradually diminish in size
on the inner secondaries; the innermost secondaries brown like the
back; tail white at the base, with a broad, black, terminal band,
gradually decreasing in size toward the outer feathers, which are
edged with white at the tip, the center feathers brownish at the tip;
head ashy brown, the forehead more hoary; an indistinct whitish eyebrow
extending from the base of the nostril to behind the eye; lores dusky
gray; below the eye a whitish spot; sides of face, sides of neck,
throat, and chest light ashy brown, a little darker on the sides
of the body; fore part of cheeks and upper throat white, as well as
the whole of the center of the breast, abdomen, under tail-coverts,
under wing-coverts, and axillars; edge of wing mottled with dark
brown bases to the feathers; quill-lining white. 'Bill pale fleshy,
blackish brown at the tip; feet olivaceous-green, toes blackish brown;
iris brown.' (Hume.) Length, 417; culmen, 112; wing, 223; tail, 76;
tarsus, 81.

"Adult female in winter plumage.--Similar to the male in color,
but rather larger. 'Bill livid pink, blackish horny at the tip; feet
blackish plumbeous, toes brownish; iris brown.' (Hume.) Length, 444;
culmen, 127; wing, 216; tail, 76; tarsus, 85.

"Adult male in summer plumage.--Differs in having the back more or
less mottled with rufous and black, crown rufous with short, broad
streaks of black, sides of face and entire neck all round rufous, fore
neck and breast overshaded with rufous and barred with dusky blackish,
these bars also developed on abdomen and on the sides of body.

"Adult female in summer plumage.--Similar to the male, but with less
rufous, and distinguished by the larger size.

"Young.--Distinguished from the adults by being darker brown above,
with broad, sandy-rufous edges to the feathers of the upper surface,
the innermost secondaries banded with blackish brown and sandy rufous;
the head rufous, streaked with dark brown, but indistinctly; sides
of face buffy white, with very fine streaks of brown; throat white;
lower throat, sides of neck, and chest reddish buff, slightly mottled
with dusky bases to the feathers of the side of breast; remainder of
under surface white, suffused with rufescent buff, and shaded with
ashy brown on the sides of the body.

"It is evident from the molting specimens in the collection that
the black markings are acquired first, and that the rufous-color
overspreads the plumage afterwards. Great variation in the amount
of the nuptial decoration is seen in the series, and sometimes very
old individuals have the abdomen, and even the under tail-coverts,
barred." (Sharpe.)

The black-tailed godwit is extremely rare in the Philippines,
the only specimens examined by me being two killed near Manila,
in February, 1908.

    Worcester); Palawan (Platen, Whitehead); Siquijor (Steere Exp.,
    Bourns & Worcester). Central and eastern Asia, south in winter
    to Malay Archipelago.


"Male.--Above rufescent broccoli-brown, the feathers everywhere with
dark brown centers, the back more or less irregularly barred with the
same; rump pure white, sparingly marked with brownish; tail and upper
tail-coverts dull white, heavily barred with sepia-brown, the terminal
portion of central tail-feathers buffy; wings fuscous, the innermost
secondaries like the back and barred on exposed portions with dark
brown; remainder of secondaries white, but pale brown on concealed
bases; greater coverts white or grayish distally, brownish gray
basally, and barred with sepia; median coverts brownish gray, barred
with sepia; lesser coverts almost plain; lower surface white, more
or less heavily marked throughout with sepia, these markings taking
on throat and breast the form of broad streaks, on flanks, sides,
and crissum of bars, and elsewhere of more or less irregular spots;
lining of wing white, varied with brownish, except on axillars. 'Length
of male, 292; of female, 298; bill black, orange-brown at base beneath;
iris dark brown; feet orange-red; claws black.' (Abbott.)

"The form of Totanus totanus inhabiting Central and Eastern Asia,
although seemingly identical with the European bird in color and
markings, is yet so much larger, particularly in length of wing,
tail, and culmen, that its separation as a subspecies appears to be
warranted." (Oberholser.)

Taking the measurements of three males and two females from
Central Asia as recorded by Oberholser gives the following average
measurements: Wing, 163; tail, 66.8; exposed culmen, 46.6; tarsus,
47.2; middle toe, 30.2.

A male from Cuyo measures: Wing, 159; tail, 61; exposed culmen, 46;
tarsus, 49; middle toe with claw, 34. A female from Cuyo, wing, 151;
tail, 59; exposed culmen, 43; tarsus, 47; middle toe with claw, 35.

I refer Philippine specimens of the redshank to the Asiatic subspecies
as being the one more likely to occur here if two races of Totanus
totanus be recognized.

"Adult male in winter plumage.--Above uniform olive-brown with
a slight gloss of bronzy olive; scapulars and wing-coverts like
back, but having a few tiny white spots on the margins; lower back
and rump darker, blackish brown with white edges to the feathers;
upper tail-coverts pure white; lesser wing-coverts, outer median,
and outer greater coverts uniform olive-brown; alula, primary-coverts,
and quills blackish brown, secondaries like the back and freckled with
tiny white spots on the edges; tail-feathers white, the center ones
with three black bars on the terminal half, these bars disappearing
gradually on the lateral feathers, outer ones being entirely white;
crown, hind neck, and mantle uniform ashy brown; a supra-loral streak
of white; lores dusky, surmounted by an indistinct, white eyebrow,
lined with blackish streaks; sides of face, ear-coverts, and cheeks
white, rather broadly streaked with blackish brown; throat white,
streaked with brown on the sides; lower throat, sides of neck, and fore
neck also distinctly streaked with brown; remainder of under surface
pure white; sides of upper breast brown, slightly mottled with white;
under wing-coverts and axillars blackish, barred very plainly with
white; lower primary-coverts and inner lining of quills uniform,
with white dots along the inner edge of the secondaries. 'Bill dusky
above, reddish beneath; feet grayish blue, tinged with green; iris
dusky.' (Macgillivray.) Length, 228; culmen, 35; wing, 137; tail,
56; tarsus, 33.

"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Differs from the winter plumage in
being much more variegated, the whole of the back being spotted with
white, the spots being arranged in pairs on the edges of the feathers,
which are also tipped with a bar or twin spots of white; the whole
of the head and neck streaked with white, and the brown streaks on
the side of the face, fore neck, and chest very broad and distinct,
the sides of the upper breast being brown, very much mottled with bars
of white. Length, 236; culmen, 35; wing, 137; tail, 55; tarsus, 30.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Does not differ in color from
the male, but is not quite so strongly marked. Length, 229; culmen,
38; wing, 142; tail, 50; tarsus, 33.

"Young in autumn plumage.--Scarcely differs from the winter plumage
of the adult, but, when freshly molted, it has indistinct margins
of ashy bronze on the feathers of the upper surface; the tail-bands
are narrower on the center feathers, while the subterminal band is
broader than in the adults.

"The change to the summer plumage is apparently effected by a distinct
molt, which takes place while the bird is in its winter quarters,
and in many instances, especially in the case of the males, the
summer plumage is completely assumed before the species leaves for
its breeding place." (Sharpe.)

"The yellow base to the lower mandible appears to me to be a sign of
immaturity and winter plumage, as it seems to disappear entirely in
breeding birds.

white; sides of neck and sides of upper breast ashy gray, the latter
with a distinct dusky patch; axillars and under wing-coverts white;
feathers along edge of wing ashy gray; quills grayish below. 'Bill
dark brown, yellowish at base of lower mandible; feet and toes yellow;
iris brown.' (Oates.)" (Sharpe.)

This curious sandpiper was met with in considerable numbers on the
tide-flats near Minglanilla, Cebu, in November, 1906. At or near
high water the species was found, in company with Heteractitis,
resting among the roots of mangrove trees and at such times it was
no uncommon occurrence to kill several specimens of each species at
one shot. As the rocky flats became exposed these birds scattered to
feed and became more difficult to approach. The bill of the female
is much longer than that of the male, but the plumage is similar
in the two sexes. In a male taken November 20, the bill was black,
except the yellow base, legs bright orange-chrome, and nails black.

feathers of upper surface sandy rufous; black centers and white
margins to many of the scapulars and feathers of the back; feathers
of head rufous, with black centers; neck rufous, streaked with dusky
blackish, these streaks being smaller and less distinct on sides of
face, which are also rufous; a slight indication of a whitish eyebrow;

less distinctly spotted on the breast. Length, 152; culmen, 18; wing,
98; tail, 37; tarsus, 20.

"Young.--Blackish above, with rufous edgings to the feathers, and
thus somewhat resembling the summer plumage of the adults, but they
may always be distinguished by the more numerous white edgings to the
dorsal and scapular feathers, by the ashy color of the hind neck,
by the absence of spots on the fore neck and chest, both of which
are tinged with isabelline-buff.

"Nestling.--Mottled with rufous and black down, the tips of which
are silvery white or sandy buff; the hind neck sandy buff, forming
a collar; the crown black, slightly mottled with rufous and dotted
with silvery white, the black extending in a line on the forehead,
which is buff, continued into a somewhat broad eyebrow; a black loral

slightly shorter tarsus. Length, 145; culmen, 18; wing, 96; tail,
42; tarsus, 19; middle toe with claw, 18.

"Adult male in summer plumage.--Much more mottled on the upper

and upper parts overspread with a brighter chestnut color, with which
the feathers are broadly margined; crown blackish, washed with rufous
and mottled with gray margins; forehead and eyebrow shaded with bright
rufous, this color occupying entire sides of face, sides of neck,
throat, and chest; chin whitish. 'Bill and feet black; iris nearly

feathers of the upper surface, and by the ashy fulvous tinge on the
fore neck, which is devoid of the dusky streaks seen in the adults.

"Nestling.--Covered with golden buff down, spotted with black, and
spangled with silvery tips to the down; the black forms a line down

"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Above deep bay or dark
cinnamon-rufous; varied with whitish edges to feathers, which are
mottled with black centers, taking the form of stripes on head and
back, and of cross-bars on scapulars; lower back dull ashy brown,
with whitish edges; sides of lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts
white, the latter tinged with rufous, and showing a few black bars;
wing-coverts brown, with whitish edgings, greater series tipped
with white, forming a wing-bar; some of the coverts rufous like the
back, and some of the inner secondaries also rufous on their edges;
primary-coverts and quills darker brown, the latter with white tips,
primaries dark brown with white shafts; secondaries fringed with white,
more broadly on the shorter ones, which are white at base of inner
webs; tail-feathers ashy brown, with white fringes and white shafts;
head like the back, but showing less distinct blackish centers to
the feathers; hind neck distinctly hoary, owing to the gray edgings
of feathers; sides of face and under surface rich vinous-chestnut;
with more or less distinct remains of hoary margins; vent and under
tail-coverts white, the latter tinged with rufous, and having a few
black bars; sides of body and flanks pure white, the latter with a
few black bars; under wing-coverts and axillars pure white; lower
primary-coverts and upper surface of quills light ashy. Bill and
feet black; iris hazel. Length, 188; culmen, 34; wing, 135; tail,

vinous. Length, 178; culmen, 35; wing, 124; tail, 46; tarsus, 29;
middle toe with claw, 25.

"Adult in winter plumage.--Ashy brown above, slightly mottled with
darker centers to the feathers; wing-coverts like the back; quills

under surface of body pure white, with tiny lines of dusky brown on
the sides of face, sides of neck, lower throat, and fore neck.

"Young in first autumn plumage.--Similar in general color to the winter
plumage of the adult, and distinguished by the absence of rufous
color in the plumage of the upper surface; on the under surface the
streaks on the fore neck are almost obsolete, and a fulvescent shade
overspreads fore neck and chest, in some specimens even extending
to the breast itself. On the upper surface it is very similar to
the winter plumage of the adult, but has always more distinct pale
edgings to the feathers, these being gradually fulvescent, while the
mantle is decidedly darker, being blackish, with pale margins to the
feathers." (Sharpe.)

So far as known this species is a rare winter visitant to the
Philippine Islands.



Genus TRINGA Linnæus, 1758.

    Mindanao? (Mearns); Negros (Steere, Bourns & Worcester). Eastern
    Siberia and Japan; in winter China to Australia and western
    Indian Peninsula.


"Adult in winter plumage.--Similar to the winter plumage of T. canutus,
being ashy gray above and white below, but easily distinguished by
the longer bill and pure white upper tail-coverts; the dusky spots
on chest and sides of body smaller and much more distinct.

"Young.--Similar to the adult winter plumage but blacker, with
conspicuous white margins to the feathers of the upper surface;
rump and upper tail-coverts spotted with black, but not barred with
dusky as in T. canutus; head like the back, black with white edges to
the feathers, but scarcely any trace of a white eyebrow, the lores
and sides of face being thickly spotted with black; throat white,
unspotted; lower throat and fore neck light brown, mottled with black
spots; upper breast and sides of body also plentifully spotted with
black, the spots on the sides of the body being large and often
arrow-shaped; axillars white, with marblings of pale ashy gray.

"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Does not differ from the winter
plumage to the same extent as in T. canutus; upper surface only
slightly suffused with rufous; scapulars and inner secondaries more or
less bright chestnut with black subterminal bars; under surface white;
throat thickly streaked and fore neck so closely barred as to become
almost black, these black bars extending on to breast and along the
sides of body; the under tail-coverts spotted with black. 'Bill brown;
feet gray; iris dark brown.' (Taczanowski.) Length, 267; culmen, 41;
wing, 175; tail, 63; tarsus, 33.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Similar to the male, but with
less rufous. Length, 267; culmen, 43; wing, 190; tail, 67; tarsus,
33." (Sharpe.)

"Coloration in winter.--Upper parts light brownish gray, with
black shaft-stripes which are broadest on the crown; sides of head
and neck whitish, with dark streaks, supercilia and cheeks paler;
wing-coverts with pale edges, greater coverts with white tips; alula,
primary-coverts, and primaries blackish brown; secondaries brownish
gray like back, but with white borders outside and at the end;
lower back and rump dark brown, with white edges to the feathers;
upper tail-coverts the same, but the white borders are much wider,
the white sometimes occupying the greater part or the whole of the
feathers; tail ashy brown; lower plumage white, fore neck and upper
breast streaked or spotted with dark brown.

"In summer the plumage is blackish above, with whitish edges to the
feathers, the scapulars with large chestnut spots; upper and lower
tail-coverts white, with dark brown spots and bars; chin, throat,
breast, and flanks so thickly spotted as to be almost covered in the
middle of the breast with blackish brown; there is no rufous on the
lower plumage." (Blanford.)

"Seen in small flocks along seashore in winter." (Bourns and Worcester
MS.)

I have identified as of this species, a sandpiper collected by Major
Edgar A. Mearns. The field tag gives no locality but I believe the
specimen came from Mindanao. This and many other species of migratory
shore-birds will doubtless be found in considerable numbers when more
attention is paid to collecting them.

primary-coverts black tipped with white, the latter broadly; quills
black, paler brown on inner webs of primaries, excepting at tips,
which are black; secondaries merely fringed with white near the ends,
and with a little white towards base of inner web; inner secondaries
ashy like back; shafts of all the quills white or whity-brown; middle

thickly spotted with dusky black like sides of neck; ear-coverts
rufous, and surmounted by a pale buff eyebrow, which becomes lighter
above the lores; chin and under surface of body white; throat, fore
neck, and chest thickly spotted with dusky blackish, the spots on the
fore neck and chest somewhat arrow-shaped, as they are also along the
sides of body, all these parts slightly tinged with rufous; lateral

very broad whitish margins; center of crown black; outer tail-feathers
with a great deal of white on inner webs, confining the ashy gray to a
broad marginal line; fore neck slightly tinged with buff, as also the
sides of the upper breast, these parts being very scantily streaked
with brown. During the first winter the pale edges become worn off,
so that the general aspect of the upper surface is black.

"The summer plumage is gained by a darkening of the center of the
feathers of the upper surface, which become gradually blacker;
the head becomes blackish, and the streaks on the breast much more
emphasized." (Sharpe.)

fore part of cheeks and chin sandy isabelline; throat and chest sandy
buff, slightly mottled with streaks and narrow horseshoe-shaped bars
of blackish; breast and abdomen white; sides of body slightly tinged
with sandy buff, and distinctly barred with black; under tail-coverts
pale sandy buff, with blackish centers, longer ones narrowly barred
with black near their ends; under wing-coverts and axillars distinctly
barred with black and white, white bars on the latter slightly wider
than the black bars; lower primary-coverts ashy; quills ashy below,
secondaries fringed with white at the ends. 'Basal half of upper bill
horny, distal half blackish brown; basal half of lower bill greenish,
remainder blackish brown; feet greenish; iris brown.' (Cripps.) Length,
223; culmen, 58; wing, 124; tail, 48; tarsus, 30.

"Adult female.--Does not perceptibly differ from the male in color
and markings. Length, 240; culmen, 62; wing, 129; tail, 44; tarsus, 30.

"It is very difficult to distinguish young birds from old ones, and
I believe that the only characters of any value are the uniform black
stripes along the sides of the crown. In old birds, not only are these
black stripes mottled with rufous, but there are also numerous small
spots of rufous-buff interspersed among the black feathers of the
back; the black subterminal marks on the scapulars are also smaller
in the young birds than in the old. A further sign of immaturity is,
I believe, to be seen in the nearly uniform fulvous-brown on the
throat and fore neck, these portions being more mottled with lines
and arrow-head spots of black in the old birds.

"From G. gallinago the present species is distinguished by the
wire-like feathers in the tail and by the entire surface of the
under wing-coverts being regularly barred with black and white, and
the outer web of the first primary being whity-brown instead of pure
white. Occasionally young birds of G. stenura have the whole of the
breast and abdomen regularly barred with dusky." (Sharpe.)

"Adult male.--Similar to G. stenura, and with wire-like outer
tail-feathers, but these not so narrow and showing at least two
distinct bars towards the ends; the tail-feathers twenty in number,
of which the seven outer ones are attenuated, and only the six central
ones show the characteristic broad subterminal band of rufous. 'Bill

    northern Asia; in winter Senegambia and northeastern Africa,
    Indian Peninsula to Malay Peninsula and the Moluccas.


"Male and female.--Crown black with a fulvous streak over median
line; a blackish streak from bill to eye, above and below which the
feathers are pale fulvous; chin whitish; throat and sides of head and
neck fulvous, streaked with black; breast and sides of body fulvous,
barred with black; abdomen and vent white; under tail-coverts fulvous,
streaked with brown; under wing-coverts barred indistinctly with
black and white; tail black, the end rufous mottled with black; upper
plumage black, edged and streaked with rich fulvous and chestnut;
wing-coverts black, barred with fulvous; quills dark brown, narrowly
edged with whitish. Bill fleshy brownish, green for two-thirds of its
length from base, remainder horny brown; iris very dark brown; legs
and feet brownish green. Length, 267; tail, 61; wing, 127; tarsus,
30; bill from gape, 58." (Oates.)

"Adult female.--Similar to the male. Length, 267; culmen, 71; wing,
135; tail, 62; tarsus, 33.

"Young.--Differs from the adult in being more rufous, especially on
the throat and neck. The black markings of the back are more broken
up and mottled with rufous bars, and the pale outer bands along the
scapulars are not so wide. Seebohm states that young snipes may be
recognized by not having a dark shaft-line on the light tips of the
upper wing-coverts, but I have found indications of the latter in
quite young birds.

"Nestling.--Covered with down of a chestnut color, interspersed with
black along the back, and prettily variegated with silvery tips to
the feathers; below the eye a whitish streak, bordered with lines of
black; under surface of body bright chestnut, with a black spot on
the throat and a black line across the fore neck." (Sharpe.)

"This species and G. stenura are likely to be confounded unless special
attention is paid to the differences between them. The first and most
unfailing point of difference is in the tail. In G. gallinago the tail
is composed of twelve, fourteen, or sixteen ordinary soft feathers;
in G. stenura there are ten soft feathers and on either side of these
a number, varying from five to nine, of narrow rigid feathers with
apparently no webs. These narrow feathers require to be looked for;
they do not strike the eye, as they are more or less hidden by the
tail-coverts and are moreover very close together. A second point of
difference lies in the coloration of the lower surface of the wing. In
the pintail snipe the axillars and the under wing-coverts are very
distinctly and regularly barred with dark brown throughout. In the
common snipe these same parts are indistinctly barred, and there is
always a patch on the coverts left quite white and unbarred. Mr. Hume
points out one or two additional differences which it may be well
to quote: In the common snipe the outer web of the first primary
is white or nearly so, and the secondaries are broadly tipped with
white; in the pintail the outer web of the first primary is of the
same color as the inner, and the secondaries are only margined with
albescent or brownish white." (Oates.)

"Adult female.--Above ashy brown, strongly glossed with olive-green,
freckled all over with transverse lines of dusky blackish, with
here and there broader bars of greenish black; some of the scapular
feathers edged with bright ocherous forming a streak down each side
of the back; long inner coverts pure white, forming another streak,
generally concealed by the scapulars; wing-coverts distinctly glossed
with olive-green and finely barred with dusky; alula, primary-coverts,
and quills pearly gray, freckled with irregular wavy lines of black,
and ocellated ovate spots of rich ocherous on outer web, and with
bars of the same color on inner web; all the quills marked with black
at base of outer web, more distinctly seen in the primaries than the
secondaries; lower back, rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail pearly
gray, with black cross-lines, rump with a few white spots, upper
tail-coverts spotted with rich ocherous, tail-feathers barred with
ocherous; crown dusky, slightly glossed with olive-green, a band of
ocherous down the center, bordered on each side by a shade of black;
round eye a cincture of isabelline whitish, reaching to a point above
ear-coverts, and surrounded by a blackish shade above and below, more
broadly in front; lores, sides of face, and throat, deep chestnut,
extending backwards round hind neck; across fore neck a broad collar of
greenish black; remainder of under surface white, extending upwards on
either side of the black præ-pectoral band; on each side of upper part
of breast a black patch with a slight greenish gloss, succeeded by some
brown feathers waved with dusky lines; axillars and under wing-coverts
white, outer ones ashy, freckled with dusky cross-lines and small spots
of white or buff. 'Bill greenish, yellowish fleshy at the tip of both
mandibles; feet pale green; iris dark brown.' (Butler.) Length, 229;
culmen, 47; wing, 140; tail, 42; tarsus, 43.

"Adult male.--Different from the female and rather smaller. Easily
distinguished from the female by the absence of chestnut on the throat
and neck, and by the different color of the wing-coverts. The latter,
instead of being olive-green barred with blackish cross-lines, are
bronzy olive, with numerous bar-like spots of yellow-ocher, these
spots having a black line above and below; the inner secondaries
similarly colored and marked. Although there is a line of sandy buff
on each side of the back, there are apparently no white parapteral
plumes. Instead of the chestnut on the throat, the latter is white with
dusky spots on the upper part, the lower throat light brown, mottled
with dusky bars and whitish margins to the feathers, the lower border
of this dusky patch edged with a band of black. 'Bill purplish brown;
feet dull slaty blue; iris dark brown.' (S. Stafford Allen.) Length,
229; culmen, 49; wing, 127; tail, 41; tarsus, 43.

"Young male.--Resembles the old male almost exactly, but has the
throat entirely white, the lower throat and fore neck washed with
brown, with some dusky streaks; these streaks on the full-grown male
are sometimes black, but the feathers of the back and scapulars have
spots or margins of white.

"Young female.--Is at first like the young male and has the same
yellow-spotted wing-coverts; the hind neck is gray, vermiculated with
dusky like the male, and the markings on the throat are similar to
those of the latter sex. When the chestnut color is first assumed, it
is of a dull tint, and is obscured by dusky margins to the feathers;
the chin is white, and the throat and fore neck uniform brown, with
which the chestnut feathers are often mingled." (Sharpe.)

"Fairly abundant about the rice-fields. Easy to bring down on
account of its comparatively slow and heavy flight. Resident in the
Philippines. We obtained its nest and eggs in Siquijor." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

"Adult female in summer.--Above dark plumbeous, the back striped with
ochraceous or buff; wings dusky, the greater coverts broadly tipped
with white; lower parts white; chest and sides of neck rufous.

"Adult male in summer.--Similar to the female, but colors duller,
the rufous almost confined to sides of neck, and less distinct,
the chest chiefly mixed with white and grayish.

"Winter plumage.--Forehead, superciliary stripe, sides of head and
neck, with lower parts generally, pure white; top of head grayish,
the feathers with dusky shaft-streaks and whitish borders; a blackish
spot in front of eye, and side of head, from beneath eye, across
ear-coverts mixed dusky and grayish white; upper parts chiefly grayish;

Adult in breeding plumage.--Sexes similar; head, chin, and throat
white; occiput and a line on each side of neck black, behind this a
large saddle of golden yellow; mantle and scapulars dark brown glossed
with violet; back, rump, and tail black; lower parts, except chin and
throat, dead black; first primary black, the other primaries mostly
white, but with some black at their tips; remainder of wing white;
axillars and wing-lining white. Iris brown, bill blue, paler at tip;
legs blue; nails blackish. Length of male about 330; wing, 190; tail,

toe without claw, 20; claw, 29. Length of female, 380; wing, 250;
tail, 162; exposed culmen, 28; tarsus, 60; middle toe with claw, 85;
hind toe with claw, 57.

Adult in non-breeding plumage.--Differs from the breeding plumage
chiefly as follows: Upper parts earthy brown with little gloss; under
parts, including tail and its coverts, white except a black plastron
on fore breast which extends forward on each side of neck; golden
collar replaced by a golden yellow band on each side; secondaries
and coverts mostly earthy brown speckled with white.

Birds in intermediate plumage present endless combinations of the
breeding and non-breeding plumage.

"Young.--Generally resembles the winter plumage of the adults, but
is always distinguished by its rufous head, and in the first stage
of plumage by the sandy rufous margins to the feathers of the upper
surface; the dusky band of the sides of the neck is feebly indicated
and the horseshoe collar on the fore neck is marked by a few spots
of dusky blackish; the white on the primaries is more restricted,
but the elongated tips are present." (Sharpe.)

"Quite abundant about the Laguna de Naujan, in Mindoro. It runs about
over the leaves of water plants, and when approached sinks its body
in the water until only its head and tail can be seen. When wounded
it dives, and sometimes hangs onto water plants below the surface
until it dies." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

This jacana is abundant in Luzon in fresh-water swamps and on the
borders of lakes.

    (Layard); Palawan (Whitehead, White). China, eastern Siberia,
    Indian Peninsula, Indo-Chinese countries; in winter Malay Peninsula
    and Archipelago to Australia.


Adult male and female.--Above nearly uniform earthy brown; tail-coverts
white; a narrow line below eye white; lores black, this color continued
in a line below eyes to ear-coverts and across breast and bordered in
front with white; sides of neck earthy brown, usually extending across
fore breast; chin, throat, and breast light rufous or ocherous-brown;
abdomen, flanks, and under tail-coverts white; primaries, secondaries,
and alula blackish; axillars and under wing-coverts bright chestnut;
white at base of tail gradually increasing in extent from the central
pair of rectrices outward; tips brown. Bill black, scarlet posteriorly
of nostrils; inside of mouth dull salmon-pink; iris brown; legs and
nails dark seal-brown. Length of male, 230; wing, 182; tail, 78;
exposed culmen, 14; tarsus, 34; middle toe with claw, 29. Female,
wing, 185; tail, 72; exposed culmen, 15; tarsus, 34.

A young female from Calayan, November 11, 1903, resembles the adult
but the black and white lines across breast are wanting, being replaced
by numerous blackish brown dashes a few of which are scattered forward
onto throat.

"Young.--Differs from the adult in having the entire upper surface
blackish, mottled with broad edgings of sandy buff to all the feathers,
especially the quills and tail-feathers; head mottled like the back;
cheeks and under surface of body isabelline-buff; fore neck and
chest mottled with black, the feathers with a broad subterminal bar
or heart-shaped spot of black.

"The sandy-buff margins to the feathers become bleached to white, and
in many respects abraded, so that the subterminal black markings of
the young plumage remain as margins to the dorsal feathers. The adult
plumage is apparently gained by a molt, and the new feathers have a
slight indication of a sandy-buff fringe on the upper parts, while the
chest is mottled with ashy, the feathers having sandy-colored margins;
the throat is at first irregularly spotted or streaked with blackish,
and has scarcely any signs of a black crescent.

"There is considerable variation with regard to the rufous color of
the throat and breast, this being sometimes very rich in tint. I
imagine that this is a sign of nesting plumage to a great extent;
but it may also indicate the age of the bird, the plumage becoming
more richly colored as the bird gets older." (Sharpe.)

"Numerous flocks seen by me on the plains of Isabela in April,
1906." (Worcester.)

During the winter months this anomalous plover visits the Philippines
in small numbers. Its deeply cleft bill and forked tail distinguish
it from all other plovers; and even while on the wing it may be
recognized by its circling, swallow-like flight.



Suborder OEDICNEMI.

of bill black; tibia lemon-yellow; tarsi and feet wine-yellow;
upper ridges of scales of toes lead-color; eyelids primrose-yellow;
iris pale yellow.' (Gould.) Length, about 483; culmen, 76; wing, 274;
tail, 109; tarsus, 84.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male in color. Length, about 508;
culmen, 71; wing, 269; tail, 109; tarsus, 83.

"Young.--Two specimens from the Duke of York Island and Guadaleanar
are apparently immature, having the feathers of the upper surface
tipped with sandy buff, especially on the wing-coverts, where the
white band on the median series is not so defined as in the adults,
but showing a broader band of brown-tipped feathers below. There is,
however, a second white band formed by the white tips to the greater
wing-coverts, and it is somewhat curious that this should be a sign
of immaturity." (Sharpe.)

The stone plover is remarkable for its large and powerful bill. It
is rare in the Philippine Islands and so far as observed it is found
on sea-beaches where it subsists upon sand-crabs.

    Tipol, Luzon.

    Luzon (McGregor, Worcester). Burma, Cochin China, and Malay
    Peninsula.


Adult.--Nearly uniform pearl-gray, lighter on neck; head and neck
nearly naked to 100 mm. or more below anterior border of ear-coverts;
a few gray feathers on chin and ear-coverts; a few scattered black
hair-like feathers on upper throat and its sides.

An adult female taken in Nueva Ecija Province, Luzon, in September,
yields the following data: Legs rose-pink, brown along the tarsi; nails
blackish; most of bill and forehead pale dirty green; tip of bill gray;
iris yellow; papillose parts of head and neck red, darker behind the
ear-coverts. Weight, 5 kilos. Length, 1,270; extent, 2,200; wing, 565;
tail, 220; culmen from base, 178; bill from front margin of nostril,
103; tarsus, 275; middle toe with claw, 117; hind toe with claw,
24. Another specimen from northern Luzon measures; culmen from base,
160; bill from nostril, 92; tarsus, 280; middle toe with claw, 107.

Sharpe's crane is abundant in the vicinity of Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija
Province, Luzon. When I observed them in September, 1908, they were
feeding in pairs and frequenting a grassy plain. Two badly decayed
eggs were taken from a nest which consisted of a little grass arranged
on the ground in circular form. The eggs are white marked with a few
lavender spots and dented with numerous, small, elongated pits. The
surface is hard and smooth, very slightly glossy, and with a few
small lumps about the larger end. When held toward the light the
shell appears through the hole to be dark green. These eggs measure
91.5 by 63 and 97.5 by 64.6.

This species has been reported from the Candaba Swamp in central Luzon
and Worcester found it abundant in northern Luzon. He says: "I saw
Antigone sharpei in large numbers in Cagayan and Isabela during my
recent trip, 1906, through those provinces. I am informed that these
birds nest on the ground in May, contenting themselves with scraping
together and flattening down a little grass on which to deposit their
eggs. About August they lose their long wing-feathers and when in
this condition can rise but a few feet from the ground. The people
of Isabela then pursue them on horseback and take them with lassoes,
although according to the statements of the hunters the birds, aided
by their wings, run about as fast as deer."

    Mindanao (Mearns). China, Africa, Jamaica, Australia, eastern
    United States, southern Europe to India.


"Adult.--Above black, with varying glossy reflections, either
bronzy purple or green; upper mantle deep maroon-chestnut, as also
lesser wing-coverts and scapulars, the latter having bronzy tips;
median and greater coverts duller and more oily green with bronze or
steel-green reflections; alula, primary-coverts, and quills entirely
glossy green, secondaries with purplish reflections; lower back, rump,
upper tail-coverts, and tail all black, with various reflections of
purple and oily or bronzy green; head and neck all round, as well as
under surface of body deep maroon-chestnut, somewhat lighter on the
chest and breast; forehead and fore part of crown glossy green, as
also base of cheeks and a slight shade below eye; under tail-coverts,
under wing-coverts, and axillars black, with metallic reflections
of green and purple, the quill-lining being similarly glossed. 'Bill
and feet dark brownish olive, iris brown.' (Guillemard.) Length, 558;
culmen, 132; wing, 284; tail, 99; tarsus, 107.

"Female.--Similar to the male in plumage, but smaller in size and
with a somewhat smaller bill.

"The winter plumage would appear to be adopted after the bird has left
for its winter quarters, as a male killed in Celebes on August 20 is
still in full red plumage. The winter plumage of the adults appears
to consist in the entire loss of the chestnut plumage of the head,
back, and scapulars; the rest of the plumage remains metallic with
the same varying shades of green and purple, but the wings are rather
more bronzy and the wing-coverts brighter metallic green. The head
and neck are entirely streaked with black and whitish, and in the
spring the red feathers of the summer plumage are gained by a molt.

"Young birds are similar to the winter plumage of the adult, but are
more of a metallic oil-green, without the beautiful shades which
distinguish the adults at all seasons. The head is dusky brown,
with a certain amount of white striping on the head and throat,
but not so much as in the adult winter plumage." (Sharpe.)

Although the only authentic record of the occurrence of the glossy
ibis in the Philippine Islands is that made by Mearns, there is every
reason to look for it in Luzon and other of the larger islands.



Family PLATALEIDÆ.

Members of this family greatly resemble herons but differ in having
the bill flattened and spatulate, the tip blunt and rounded; from
each of the nostrils there is a groove which extends parallel to the
edge of the mandible and meets the opposite groove at tip of bill.

"Adult male.--Entirely white with a small but full nuchal crest;
bare forehead black, the black skin extending just behind the eye
and occupying the sides of the face, fore parts of cheeks, and upper
throat, on which the white feathers impinge in a triangular form
in the center; a yellow spot in front of the eye. 'Bill slate-color,
transversely barred with black, the bars broken and disconnected on the
spatule; apical edge black, succeeded by a patch and scattered spots
of orange-ocher over the spatule, which is also freckled with light
slate-color; inside of mouth deep indigo-black; inside of nostrils
ocherous; bare skin of face black, with a bright yellow-ocher patch
before eye, extending over under lid, and a thin line over upper lid;
legs purplish black; iris blood-red.' (Swinhoe.) Length, 685; culmen,
183; wing, 371; tail, 107; tarsus, 121.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male. 'Bill flesh-color, longitudinally
streaked and speckled with blackish, mottled and freckled with

brown; feet purplish black; iris yellowish brown.' (Swinhoe.) Length,
660; culmen, 185; wing, 356; tail, 102; tarsus, 119.

"Young.--Differs from the adults in having a more yellowish bill,
and blackish shaft-stripes to the quills; outer primaries blackish
at ends of outer webs." (Sharpe.)

Mr. Charles S. Banks of the Bureau of Science brought the head of
a spoonbill from Dagupan, Luzon, where he found this species not
uncommon in November, 1907. While I have referred this specimen to
Platalea minor its specific identity is uncertain.

"Adult male.--Above black, glossed with metallic green and purple, more
especially on hind neck; entire back and upper tail-coverts glossed
with metallic green; tail-feathers black, not to be confounded with
the under tail-coverts, which are white; the outer retrices black,
graduated, and forming a fork; wing-coverts like the back, but
more distinctly glossed, especially on the lesser series, which are
metallic purplish red; quills black, glossed with slaty externally
and with metallic green on the inner face of all the quills, crown
of head blue-black as far as occiput; nape and entire neck white as
well as the throat; chin less thickly clothed with feathers; breast
black, slightly glossed with metallic green, but more strongly with
reddish purple, especially on the fore neck and chest; abdomen and

hue.' (H. J. Rainey.) Length, 914; culmen, 145; wing, 470; tail, 183;
tarsus, 157.

"Young birds differ from the adults in being much browner and not
having so much gloss, the black feathers on the head being replaced
by bronzy brown, the purplish gloss on the wing-coverts almost
absent, and the purple gloss on the breast being replaced by dull
bronzy brown. The forehead generally shows a basal line of white
feathers, but these are also apparent in some of the old birds,
and are apparently shed by them in course of time." (Sharpe.)

Specimens obtained in Mindoro have an unfeathered band along the
under side of the forearm. The skin of this space is dark crimson.

"Rather rare and very shy. Usually seen soaring at great
heights. Occasionally met with perching on dead trees, or wading
about the rice-fields." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Genus ARDEA Linnæus, 1758.

The herons of this typical genus are of large size and except in
plumage differ little from the members of Pyrrherodia but the bill
is comparatively heavier and the claws much shorter; tarsus two to
two and one-half times the length of hind toe with claw.

"Adult in breeding plumage.--General color above light ashy gray,
scapular plumes, parapteral feathers, and innermost secondaries
elongated and forming narrow drooping plumes of pearly gray or white;
the wing-coverts gray like back, the outer ones pearly gray or white,
the greater series dark ashy, outer webs entirely white; alula,
primary-coverts, and quills purplish black, secondaries shaded with
gray externally, inner secondaries like back; tail-feathers entirely
gray; crown of head crested, white in the center, with a broad band of
purplish black on each side, ending in a crest on occiput, and having
two elongated nuchal plumes; entire sides of face, neck all round,
and under surface of body white, with a creamy lilac shade on each
side of fore neck and chest, which have drooping plumes of narrow,
elongated, white feathers; the whole of the lower throat and fore neck
varied with elongated black stripes, differing in breadth and situated
on one side of the feather; on each side of the crop is a large patch
of drooping plumes of purplish black, and continued along the sides of
the body even as far as the vent; sides of body light ashy gray; thighs
and under tail-coverts white; under wing-coverts ashy gray. 'Bill
yellow, with the ridge of the upper mandible brown towards the end;
feet dull green; tibia yellow; claws black; iris yellow; bare space
between the bill and the eye green.' (Macgillivray.) Length, 762;
culmen, 129; wing, 457; tail, 183; tarsus, 173.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male and equally beautifully colored,
but the black crest-plumes not so long, and the black markings on
the chest not quite so pronounced. Length, about 762; culmen, 124;
wing, 452; tail, 170; tarsus, 162.

"Young.--Differs from the adult in being darker and not so pure gray;
head dark slate-color, with a small nuchal crest of purplish black,
neck rather lighter ashy; sides of face and ear-coverts also ashy gray;
cheeks and throat white; neck dark slaty gray, as also the sides of
the body, under wing-coverts, and axillars; lower throat, fore neck,
and chest very broadly streaked with black, the black very thickly
developed on throat, sparsely on fore neck, and represented by a few
black streaks on sides of body; on each side of chest the black patch
of the adult is represented by a dusky patch of feathers, relieved by
several broad white streaks; on bend of wing a tinge of rust-color,
which also pervades the black-streaked feathers of throat and fore
neck." (Sharpe.)

"Rare. Not met with by us on our second visit to the Islands." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

The common heron is rare in the Philippines but may be recognized by
the pale gray head and neck, set off by the black crest, line on side
of head, and broken line on throat. A very much damaged specimen in
the Bureau of Science collection has unfortunately no data as to its
source but it was probably killed in Luzon.

pearly white at the ends; wing-coverts and quills dark slaty gray,
with a slight greenish gloss on some of them; innermost secondaries
elongated and tipped with pearly white, like scapulars; tail-feathers
dark slate-color, slightly glossed with green; crown of head slaty
gray and crested, crest-feathers with dusky margins, and with some
long drooping plumes on nape, which are pearly white at the ends;
sides of face and hinder cheeks pale vinaceous-brown; fore part
of cheeks and upper throat white; neck all round slaty brown,
the feathers mostly elongated, and with a mesial streak of white
towards the ends; plumes on the fore neck similarly colored, but
very much elongated; remainder of under surface slaty gray, paler on
abdomen with longitudinal white centers to the feathers, these being
indistinct upon abdomen and under tail-coverts; on each side of upper
breast a large patch of slaty gray feathers, very slightly streaked
with white; under wing-coverts and axillars slaty gray with white
streaks; marginal feathers round bend of wing white. 'Bill black,
lower mandible yellowish white at base; legs and feet black, soles
faded yellow; iris pale orange.' (H. O. Forbes.) Length, about 1,143;
culmen, 173; wing, 465; tail, 155; tarsus, 170.

"Young.--Differs from the adult in having no elongated plumes,
and being everywhere browner; feathers of the upper surface tipped
with a rufous or sandy-buff spot; feathers of neck and under parts
vinaceous-rufous with mesial streaks of white, the whole under surface
very thickly streaked." (Sharpe.)

This is the very largest of Philippine herons and it may be known at
once by its almost uniform slate-gray color. In a male from Bohol
the iris was red; bill black, with some yellow on lower mandible;
legs and nails blackish brown. Wing, 440; tail, 170; culmen from
frontal feathers, 180; tarsus, 164; middle toe with claw, 126; hind
toe with claw, 77.



Genus MESOPHOYX Sharpe, 1894.

Of medium size; plumage all white and with long dorsal plumes during
the breeding season; primaries exceed the secondaries by length of
hind toe with claw; legs and feet black; toes long, culmen much less
than middle toe without claw.

"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Pure white above and below; the head
crested, but having no drooping plumes; long ornamental plumes of back
immensely developed, being 430 mm. in length; feathers on the fore
neck beautifully developed, 200 mm. long, the webs entirely broken up;
bare part of tibia entirely black like the tarsi and toes. 'Bill black,
facial skin green; iris yellow; feet and toes black.' (Oates.) Length,
about 208; culmen, 74; wing, 317; tail, 137; tarsus, 114; middle toe
with claw, 99.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, but the ornamental plumes not
so much developed.

"Adults in winter plumage.--Pure white, but losing the ornamental
plumes altogether. 'Bill yellow, with blackish tip.' (Oates.)

"Young.--Entirely like the adults in winter plumage; the texture of
the plumage soft and downy, and devoid of ornamental plumes." (Sharpe.)

"Comparatively rare and very shy. Fairly abundant about the Laguna
de Naujan in Mindoro." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus HERODIAS Boie, 1822.

Of very large size and plumage entirely pure white.



138. HERODIAS TIMORIENSIS (Lesson).

TIMOR WHITE EGRET.

    Luzon (McGregor); Mindanao (Mearns). Northern China and Japan
    to Australia.


Adult male in breeding plumage.--"Entirely pure white; a bunch of
elongated plumes on the back scarcely reaching beyond the tail. 'Bill
beautiful orange; naked space before and behind the eye fine greenish
yellow; legs above the knee pale dull yellow, this color continued
down the center of the inner part of the tarsi; remainder of tarsi
and feet black.' (Gould.) Length, 762; culmen, 112; wing, 381; tail,
160; tarsus, 132 to 162." (Sharpe.)

The following data are from the Luzon specimen which I have recorded:
Killed on the Laguna de Bay, Luzon, March 16, 1906. Sexed by the
taxidermist as a male. Entire legs and feet black; bill yellow. Dorsal
plumes reaching little beyond base of tail, the bird being in rather
poor plumage. Tarsus, 159; bill from gape, 140; culmen from frontal
feathers, 114. This species is the largest as well as the rarest of
the pure white herons known from the Philippine Islands.



Genus EGRETTA Forster, 1817.

This genus appears to be closely related to Mesophoyx but the bill is
longer and more slender; toes and claws shorter; culmen longer than
middle toe with claw, primaries and secondaries about equal in length.

"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Everywhere snowy white, with
two elongated plumes depending from nape; dorsal plumes enormously
elongated into a beautiful tuft of feathers, which reach a little
beyond the tail and are recurved at the ends; on the fore neck some
elongated narrow plumes. 'Bill black; bare skin about the eye and
base of bill, whitish fulvescent; tarsi and shanks black, feet
greenish yellow, joints of toes spotted with black on the upper
surface; iris pale ashy yellow, with an outer circle of brownish
red.' (T. Ayres.) Length, about 508; culmen, 84; wing, 267; tail,

quite so much developed. Length, 571; culmen, 88; wing, 287; tail,
99; tarsus, 95; middle toe with claw, 93.

"Adult in winter plumage.--Differs from that of the summer plumage
in the want of all the ornamental plumes.

"Young.--Resembling the winter plumage of the adult." (Sharpe.)

The lesser and little white egrets are birds of wide distribution,
usually found singly along sandy shores or in the vicinity of mangrove
swamps.



Genus DEMIGRETTA Blyth, 1846.

In size of body and proportional size of bill, legs, and feet this
genus is very similar to Egretta but the legs are feathered nearer
to the heel and the plumage is normally slate-blue.

    north to Japan and Korea.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--General color deep blackish slate;
head almost black; feathers of upper breast elongated like those of
the middle of the back, some of the latter decomposed; the elongated
feathers of a paler slaty gray, and those of back reaching to end
of tail; head crested and of the same color as the back; abdomen and
vent-feathers tinged with ashy; a pure white streak down the center of
the throat. Length, 584; culmen, 71; wing, 254; tail, 79; tarsus, 74.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Similar to the male, but the
ornamental plumes slightly less developed. Length, 533; wing, 259.

"Young.--Paler and more sooty brown than the adults, and bleaching
often to a slight earthy brown. No ornamental plumes on head, back,
and chest.

"Adult birds, either in winter plumage or perhaps in the second year,
are blacker than in the summer plumage. Some of these black-plumage
birds have ornamental feathers which looks as if they were fully
adult, and therefore they may be birds of the second year, as it is
quite evident that the grayer plumaged ones are very old and perfect
in livery.

"The white streak down the throat is often absent or reduced to a
few spots. It appears to be absent equally in quite young birds and
in old ones also, and it may be the result of inherent melanism in
the species.

"The white form is exactly similar in size to the gray form, and,
when adult, has the same ornamental plumes. In the Pacific islands
the two forms appear to interbreed, and produce white young ones
mottled or streaked with slaty gray. I have been unable to recognize
any of the many forms into which the reef heron has been subdivided by
naturalists. Some birds are larger, as will be seen by the measurements
of the tarsi given in detail below, and these larger birds have a
slightly longer wing and a heavier bill, but no specific distinctions
can be founded on these variations, which are very slight." (Sharpe.)

"The color of the soft parts is excessively variable. In the adult the
bare portion of the tibia varies from dark grass-green to greenish
plumbeous; the back and sides of the tarsus and the greater part of
the toes are generally pea-green, sometimes duller, sometimes yellower;
the front of the tarsus and the first joint of the mid toe black, but
sometimes these parts are green, only patched or mottled with black,
and sometimes the black extends along the ridges of all the toes;
the color of the bill and bare skin in front of the eye varies from
sienna-brown to chocolate; sometimes the bill is a sort of light
mahogany color, and the bare skin a sort of greenish brown; usually
the bills are yellowish at the tips; the lower mandible is generally
lighter, sometimes brownish horny, sometimes yellowish horny; and in
the breeding-plumage the whole lower mandible becomes apparently a
very decided, though dull, yellow; the irides vary from bright to deep
yellow. I suspect, though we have not been able to work it out, that
these differences in color are due both to age and to season." (Hume.)

"Quite common along the reefs. The young were met with on various
occasions far inland along fresh-water streams, but we never found
fully mature birds in such localities." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

So far as observed, this species is solitary and found only on rocky
shores, usually where coral flats are exposed at low tide.



Genus NYCTICORAX Forster, 1817.

Bill stout; legs rather short; tarsus about equal to middle toe with
claw and little longer than exposed culmen; tarsus covered with
hexagonal scales; head decorated with two or three long, slender,
nuchal plumes and a full crest.

    Calayan (McGregor); Luzon (Meyen, Steere Exp., McGregor); Mindanao
    (Everett). Africa, central and southern Europe to Indian Peninsula,
    Malay Peninsula, China and Japan; Greater Sunda Islands to Celebes.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--Black above, glossed with dark
green, and with a slight shade of slaty gray on the mantle; upper
scapulars like the back, lower ones light ashy gray; wings entirely
light ashy gray or dove-color, with a slight shade of dull oily green
on secondaries; lower back, rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail clear
gray or dove-color; head crested, black, and with a dark green gloss,
and having two long white nuchal plumes; base of forehead white,
extending above eye to behind the latter; feathers below the eye,
cheeks, throat, and under parts pure white; ear-coverts and sides
of neck delicate isabelline gray, extending in a collar round hind
neck, and to sides of body; thighs and under tail-coverts white;
under wing-coverts and axillars very pale ashy. Length, about 457;
culmen, 76; wing, 267; tail, 102; tarsus, 71.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Similar to the male in color and
having the same long white plumes on the nape. Upper mandible slaty
black with a whitish streak near the edges, central portion of lower
mandible flesh-color, greenish towards base; skin round the eye pale
green; tarsi and feet pale yellow; iris crimson." (T. Ayres.)

"Adults in winter plumage.--Similar to the breeding plumage, but much
greener on head and back, and not having the drooping white plumes
on the nape.

"Young.--Brown above, varied with longitudinal triangular centers of
rufous or buff to the feathers of back and wing-coverts; quills and
tail-feathers tipped with white; head blackish, crest-feathers centered
with rufous; sides of face and under surface of body fulvescent,
streaked with dusky black, with which the feathers are margined;
thighs, under wing-coverts, and axillars streaked like the sides of
body; throat whitish.

"The full-grown young bird is similarly marked to the nestling
described, but all the streaks and spots are much paler, the
throat and under surface of the body being white, with a few dusky
streaks. Judging from a specimen in the Tweeddale Collection from
Canton, the adult plumage is assumed during the next breeding season,
and even the white nape-plumes are put on, but the coloring of the
head and back is not so bright as in older birds." (Sharpe.)

The common night heron in abundant in parts of Luzon but is not so
widely distributed in the smaller islands as is the next species.

"Quite common, but very local in its habits. Feeds at night. Roosts
during the day in lofty trees, frequently choosing trees which stand
out in the open." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Oates records two eggs of the Manila night heron which were collected
by the Steere Expedition in Siquijor, February 15, and two eggs taken
by Moseley in May. The measurements are respectively: 56.3 by 36.8;
49.7 by 36.3; 60.9 by 37.5; 50.8 by 33.7.



Genus GORSACHIUS Bonaparte, 1855.

This genus resembles Nycticorax in having a short stout bill, deep
nasal groove, and stout legs and toes; it differs in having the
elongated crest feathers shorter and wider and in the coloration of
the plumage. The tarsus is covered with hexagonal scales but those
in front are very wide and appear as transverse plates.

"Adult male.--Above uniform cinnamon-rufous, wing-coverts and mantle
with a slight ashy shade and with a certain amount of indistinct
freckling; alula-feathers black or slightly mottled with rufous and
having broad white tips; outer primary-coverts black, broadly tipped
with white and rufous at the base; remainder of primary-coverts
cinnamon-rufous slightly tipped with white; quills black, externally
shaded with gray, broadly tipped with cinnamon-rufous, narrowly
fringed with white at the ends; outer primaries with a large white
terminal spot; inner secondaries like back; upper tail-coverts and
tail dark slate-color, with a slight rufescent tinge at the ends of
inner web; crown and long nuchal crest-feathers slaty gray or black;
a narrow line of feathers over eye vinous-cinnamon, broadening out
above ear-coverts and occupying the sides of crown, sides of neck,
and sides of face; chin and center of throat pale isabelline brown,
streaked with black down the center of throat, the black markings
on the feathers being lateral and somewhat irregular in shape,
the inner webs paler and cream-colored, imparting a rather broadly
streaked appearance to the fore neck; center of breast and abdomen
white or creamy buff, the feathers notched and barred with dusky,
more distinct on the sides; abdomen fulvescent and under tail-coverts
white, both of them scarcely spotted at all; under wing-coverts white,
regularly spotted and barred with dusky; axillars regularly banded
with black and white; quills ashy gray below, with the same rufous and
white tips as on the upper surface. Culmen black, sides of the upper
mandible and the lower one fleshy; legs and feet greenish, washed
with brown on the front of the tarsus and toes. 'Iris golden yellow,
frosted or stippled with olive at the exterior; gape, orbital and
loral skin greenish and slaty.' (W. V. Legge.) Length, 508; culmen,
51; wing, 269; tail, 102; tarsus, 68.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male.

"The sequence of plumages in these night herons is not very easy to
follow, but the nestling from Mindanao clearly proves that the first
plumage is spotted with white and that the quills have broad white
tips. Both G. melanolophus and G. goisagi occur on Mindanao, but the
latter is doubtless only a winter visitor, while the former bird is
resident. The same thing occurs in the Island of Formosa, as has been
duly pointed out by Mr. Seebohm, in his 'Birds of the Japanese Empire,'
where the difference between the two species has been correctly given.

"In the Hume collection there are several rufous-colored birds, which
have not yet entirely divested themselves of the wavy immature plumage,
while a female from Dibrughur is beginning to put on rufous plumage,
though it is still for the most part in the mottled dress of the
young. The birds from the Nicobars are decidedly smaller and darker
than birds from the mainland, and the wing does not exceed 240 mm.

"Young.--Entirely different from the adult, being brown above,
thickly mottled and freckled with dusky blackish, and with longitudinal
ochraceous shaft-streaks to the feathers of upper surface; wings like
the back; primary-coverts for the most part rufous, freckled with
dusky, quills black, tipped with white; primaries with a subterminal
shade of rufous; tail-feathers slaty black; crown and nape crested,
the feathers black, with arrow-shaped spots or bars of white; sides of
face and sides of neck regularly barred with ocherous brown and black,
with mesial white spots on the feathers on the sides of the neck;
chin and upper throat uniform white; the center of the lower throat
and fore neck generally pale vinaceous-buff, varied with black streaks
and black mottling or bars, the feathers being browner laterally;
sides of the body like the breast, similarly mottled and streaked with
white; under tail-coverts white, with scarcely any black markings;
under wing-coverts white mottled with dusky; axillars barred with
black and white." (Sharpe.)

"Comparatively rare. Met with about the fish-pens of the natives,
especially just at dusk." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"The eggs of the Malay bittern in the collection are of a pale
bluish-white color. Two specimens measure respectively: 45.7 by 35.5;
48.2 by 35.5." (Oates.)

The above-described eggs were collected in Palawan, June 27,
by Whitehead.

    (1906), 34.

    Luzon (Heriot); Mindanao (Steere Exp.). Japan and Formosa.


"Adult.--Differs from G. melanolophus in its deep vinous-chestnut
head, which has a little shade of blackish on the forehead only; the
mantle is browner, and the upper surface generally never seems to be
free from dusky vermiculations; axillars black and rufous instead of
black and white, and no white tips to the outer primaries. Length,
457; culmen, 39; wing, 259; tail, 94; tarsus, 63.

"Young.--Differs from the adult in being browner and more uniform
on upper mantle and back, but with the wings much freckled with
rufous-buff; crown dusky blackish, inclining to dark vinous on the
neck. The young bird differs from the young of G. melanolophus by
the rufous tips to the primaries.

"The description of the young bird is taken from a bird procured by
Mr. Ringer at Nagasaki, which still retains some of the nestling
down on the head. Full-grown birds, exactly similar in plumage,
are in the collection from Luzon and Ayala in Mindanao. 'Bill green,
culmen black; legs and feet green; iris yellow.' (Moseley.)" (Sharpe.)

"Adult male.--Above light slaty gray, feathers of back with hoary,
white shaft-lines; long scapular-feathers green, or green with gray
tips; wing-coverts and quills dark green with ocherous-buff margins,
inclining to white on the edges of the greater-coverts and secondaries,
most of the quills being fringed with white at the ends; lower back,
rump, and upper tail-coverts dull green, more or less powdered with
gray; tail dull green; crown dark glossy green, with the nape feathers
produced into a point; hind neck and sides of neck gray, extending over
the sides of face and ear-coverts; below the eye a streak of greenish
black extending along the ear-coverts, along the upper part of which
runs a whitish streak from behind the eye to the level of the nape;
another streak of white from the base of the lower mandible along the
cheeks; throat, fore neck, and abdomen white; sides of body and flanks,
including the overhanging feathers on the sides of the upper breast,
slaty gray like the sides of the neck, leaving the center of throat
and fore neck white, slightly varied with dingy brown markings,
these markings being on the edges of the throat-feathers; axillars
and under wing-coverts gray, like the quill-lining. 'Upper mandible
black, with a longitudinal yellow streak along the margin below the
nostrils; grape greenish brown; lower mandible greenish yellow, more
or less black along the edges; facial skin green; legs and toes green,
front of tarsus and toes dusky, soles orange, and claws horn-color;
iris yellow.' (Oates.) Length, 483; culmen, 70; wing, 178; tail, 63;
tarsus, 51; middle toe with claw, 53.

"Adult female.--Exactly like the male, but a trifle more dingy,
especially in the throat markings, where the brown is a little more
distinct on the margins of the feathers. Length, 457; culmen, 61;
wing, 173; tail, 70; tarsus, 46; middle toe with claw, 51.

"Winter plumage.--Duller than in summer and much greener above,
without any gray shading; the head green.

"Young.--Brown above; the wing-coverts with triangular whitish or
sandy-buff spots at their ends; head black, streaked with ocherous-buff
shaft-lines; sides of face and under surface of body whitish, strongly
streaked with dusky-blackish margins to the feathers.

"The young bird is browner than the adults, with white mesial streaks
on the wing-coverts; crown of head dusky black; under surface of body
less gray and washed with brown." (Sharpe.)

"Extremely common. Found both along the seashore and about fresh-water

146. BUTORIDES AMURENSIS (Schrenck).

AMUR GREEN HERON.


    Ardea virescens var. amurensis Schrenck, Reis. Amurl. (1860),
    1, 437.
    Butorides amurensis Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1898), 26,

    (1906), 34.

    Calayan (McGregor); Cebu (Everett, McGregor); Luzon (Whitehead);
    Palawan (Everett); Samar (Steere). Greater Sunda Islands, China,
    Japan, Celebes, Amurland.


Although in color this species seems to be exactly like B. javanica it
is much larger; the length of wing is particularly noticeable and the
bill is longer, and deeper. A male collected by Major Mearns measures:
Wing, 210; tail, 73; culmen from frontal feathers, 66; depth of bill at
posterior border of nostril, 15; tarsus, 54; middle toe with claw, 62.

A female from Calayan measures: Wing, 197; tail, 69; culmen from
frontal feathers, 64; depth of bill at posterior border of nostril,
13; tarsus, 52; middle toe with claw, 54.

Some of the records for B. javanica probably refer to the present
species but it is impossible to disentangle them.



147. BUTORIDES SPODIOGASTER Sharpe.

NICOBAR GREEN HERON.


    Butorides spodiogaster Sharpe, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1894),
    3, 17; Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1898), 26, 182, pl. 2; Hand-List
    (1899), 1, 200; Mearns, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A, 353.

    Palawan (Mearns). Andaman and Nicobar Islands.


"Adult.--Similar to B. javanica, but darker gray on the under
surface, which is of a sooty-slate color with a slight tinge of
rusty on the abdomen, cheeks and ear-coverts uniform slate-color. It
much resembles B. stagnatilis, especially the birds from Flores,
but it is not so dingy underneath and has a less shade of rusty on
the abdomen. 'Bill black, lower portion of lower mandible, from base
to tip, edged pale horny; front of tarsus, toes, and claws brownish
green, bare portion of tibia and back of tarsus dirty greenish yellow;
naked skin round eye dull green, tinged with yellow in front; eyelids
deep green.' (Hume.) Length, 445; culmen, 60; wing, 193; tail, 53;
tarsus, 43." (Sharpe.)

This species differs from both B. javanica and amurensis in its much
darker color, particularly of the under parts which are nearly uniform
slate-gray; the white of chin and throat is much restricted and on the
fore breast is reduced to a few shaft-lines; all of the wing-coverts
are edged with dull rusty buff. The specimen collected by Mearns near
Palawan measures: Wing, 165; tail, 58; culmen from frontal feathers,
60; tarsus, 47; middle toe with claw, 50.

Adult in breeding plumage.--White; head, neck, and fore breast golden
buff; long decomposed dorsal plumes delicate vinaceous-pink, washed
with brown; ends of the plumes on fore breast also vinaceous-pink. Iris
light lemon-yellow; bill and bare skin around eye chrome-yellow; legs
and nails black. A male from Mariveles, Luzon, measures: Length, 540;
wing, 265; tail, 98; exposed culmen, 63; tarsus, 95; middle toe with
claw, 89.

Young.--Pure white, without any ornamental plumes but with an orange
tinge on the crown.

Winter plumage.--Pure white, without any ornamental plumes.

This bird is often seen in large flocks and individuals alight
fearlessly on the backs of cattle; they often feed in plowed
fields. Several hundreds of cattle egrets nested in a patch of giant
grass near Guindulman, Bohol. Eggs obtained in June vary in length from
40 to 50 mm. and in width from 30 to 35. They are pale blue in color.

"Adult male.--Above earthy brown, slightly tinged with rufous, more
especially on the scapulars; wing-coverts clay-brown, greater series
rather paler on the edges; edge of wing white; alula, primary-coverts,
and quills black, slightly shaded with ashy; inner secondaries brown,
tinged with rufous; lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts ashy

yellow.' (Oates). Length, 394; culmen, 51; wing, 124; tail, 38;
tarsus, 44.

"Adult female.--Differs from the male in being more rufous above, the
feathers of the upper surface being rufous-brown with yellowish-buff
margins; the crown is black as in the male, the ear-coverts and
sides of the face are yellowish buff, and the neck-frill is also
washed with the latter color; the under surface of the body the
same as that of the male, but having the mesial lines more strongly

feet greenish yellow.' (Butler.) Length, 394; culmen, 53; wing, 132;
tail, 41; tarsus, 51.

"Young.--Similar to the old female and streaked in the same manner,
but distinguished by having wing-coverts broadly centered with dark
brown; crown streaked instead of being uniform; feathers black with
yellowish buff margins, and under surface of body much more distinctly
streaked, centers of the feathers being dark brown on throat and fore
neck; flank-feathers also streaked with brown." (Sharpe.)

"Extremely abundant about Lake Naujan, in Mindoro. It comes out on
the mud flats to feed, but promptly takes refuge among the reeds if
disturbed." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester); Ticao (McGregor). China,
    Eastern Siberia, Indian Peninsula, Indo-Malayan subregion;
    Celebes in winter.


"Adult male.--Entirely cinnamon-rufous above, including wings and tail;
sides of face and ear-coverts cinnamon-rufous; cheeks a little lighter
rufous; throat ashy white, with a median streak of tawny-rufous,
which extends down throat and fore neck, being streaked with blackish
longitudinal marks on the outer webs of the feathers; lower throat,
fore neck, breast, sides of body, and thighs tawny-rufous; abdomen
white; under tail-coverts tawny-buff; on sides of upper breast a
patch of dependent feathers, having black centers with tawny-buff
or rufous margins; under wing-coverts tawny-buff; axillars and
under surface of quills pale chestnut. 'Eyelids and facial skin
reddish purple; bill nearly all yellow, the culmen alone being dark
brown; legs and toes yellowish green; claws brown; iris yellow to
pale red.' (Oates.) Length, 279; culmen, 46; wing, 140; tail, 41;
tarsus, 48.

"Adult males in winter appear to be a little more dingy on the upper
parts than in summer, the head and back being shaded with grayish
brown.

"Adult female.--Mantle and back uniform dark brown; wing-coverts dingy
brown, but mottled with sandy-buff margins and checkered notches,
which appear also on scapulars and inner secondaries, and have also
subterminal markings of darker brown on many of the coverts; greater
coverts, primary-coverts, and quills chestnut, with a good deal
of dusky at base and on the inner webs, primary-coverts also dusky
towards the ends; tail-feathers dull chestnut; crown and nape dusky
brown; frilled feathers on the sides of neck brown in the center, with
yellowish margins; sides of face yellowish buff, streaked with brown;
whole of the under surface yellowish buff, very thickly streaked with
dark brown, sides of throat whiter, feathers composing the broad mesial
streak down the middle of throat and fore neck having a distinct rufous
shade; on each side of the upper breast a patch of dependent plumes,
black in the center with yellowish-buff margins; thighs chestnut; under
wing-coverts yellowish buff like the chest; axillars and quill-lining
dull chestnut, the feathers with a good deal of gray in them. 'Facial
skin, margins of upper mandible, and nearly the whole of the lower
mandible yellow, remainder of bill black; back of tarsus and soles
yellow; claws yellowish brown; iris yellow.' (Oates.) Length, 330;
culmen, 51; wing, 136; tail, 43; tarsus, 44.

"The young birds are very like the female, as determined by Mr. Oates
and myself, but the whole back is variegated with yellowish-buff spots
and markings, as well as the wings, so that the uniform brown mantle
is a sign of the adult female, and the spotted mantle of a young
bird. Mr. Everett gives the soft parts of a young female as follows:
'Legs and feet bright olive-green; bill greenish yellow at base,
the culmen of a dark olive-brown tint; iris golden yellow.'

"Considerable variation in the tint of the cinnamon plumage of this
species is observable in a series, and specimens from more southern
localities are decidedly the darker and richer in color." (Sharpe.)



Genus NANNOCNUS Stejneger, 1887.

sides of the neck; under surface of body ocherous-buff, plentifully
streaked with blackish brown, tinged with rufous; the lower abdomen
and under tail-coverts whiter; under wing-coverts deep ocherous, with
ashy bases; a patch of brown feathers at the sides of the breast,
all edged with ocherous. Length, 305; culmen, 49; wing, 140; tail,
29; tarsus, 48.

"Young.--Like the old female, but blackish brown above, the
wing-coverts maroon-chestnut, and all the upper parts spotted
with white instead of ocherous. 'Bill bright yellow, tinged
with green; culmen black; feet yellowish green; iris golden

    countries, Greater Sunda Islands, southern and central China.


"Adult male.--Above dark slaty gray, feathers of back and scapulars
somewhat pointed and with a slight hoary gloss; wings and tail
blackish, glossed with slate-color on the coverts, and with green on
some of the latter and on the quills; crown and crest-plumes slaty
gray; sides of face and cheeks black, the latter slightly mottled
with rufous; from the hinder part of the cheeks a band of golden
straw-color runs down the sides of the neck, the lower feathers being
elongated; throat and fore neck prettily variegated with chestnut,
black, and white, the chestnut predominating on the outer webs of the
feathers and the white on the inner webs, with a longitudinal streak
of black at the end of the latter, the long overlapping feathers on
the sides of the chest being slaty gray with white margins, so that
the general appearance of the throat and chest is streaked; remainder
of under surface of body slaty gray, including the under wing-coverts,
axillars, and quill-lining. 'Bill dusky reddish brown, lighter below;
facial skin purplish brown; eyelids bluish; feet dark brown; claws
dark horn-color; iris golden brown or pale red.' (Oates). Length, 508;
culmen, 84; wing, 203; tail, 63; tarsus, 67; middle toe with claw, 76.

"Adult female.--Does not differ from the male. Length, 508; culmen,
31; wing, 203; tail, 68; tarsus, 66; middle toe with claw, 74.

"The slaty gray shade in the plumage appears to be a sign of the
breeding season, as some of the winter specimens are black with a
greenish gloss on the upper surface.

"Young birds are much browner than the adults, and can immediately
be recognized by their more freckled appearance, the feathers of the
upper surface having ochraceous margins. The mottling of the rufous
on the neck is much as in the adult birds but there is more white and
less rufous, and the chest-feathers are much more broadly edged with
white; the breast is dusky brown as well as the sides of the body; the
abdomen is white; the sides of the face and ear-coverts are chestnut,
with a little streak of white at the base of the mandible.

"Nestling.--Similar in color to the young bird described above, but
very much shaded with rufous, and having a great deal of rufous on the
sides of the face; the crown covered with down of an ocherous color,
the throat and chest very rufous." (Sharpe.)



Genus BOTAURUS Stephens, 1819.


The genus Botaurus is distinguished by its large size, comparatively
short and stout bill and heavy legs; culmen much less than tarsus,
the latter less than middle toe with claw; secondaries and scapulars
nearly or quite as long as primaries.

"Adult male.--Above tawny-yellow and black, the latter predominating
and occupying the center of the feathers, the sides of which are
tawny-buff, freckled and irregularly barred with black; lower back,
rump, and upper tail-coverts pale tawny-buff, mottled with bars or
cross-lines of dusky brown; marginal wing-coverts rufous, regularly
barred across with black; median and greater coverts tawny-buff,
with irregular bars or arrow-shaped markings of blackish brown, much
less pronounced on the greater coverts, all of which have a rufescent
tinge near the base; alula, primary-coverts, and quills blackish,
barred with rufous, the bars somewhat broken up on the inner webs
of the quills, which are also paler; the inner secondaries like the
scapulars, being tawny-buff on their edges and mottled in a similar
manner; tail-feathers tawny-buff, irregularly mottled with black bars
or cross-markings, more pronounced on the middle of the feathers;
crown of head uniform black, with a frill of erectile plumes on the
nape, these being tipped with tawny-buff, and the pale tips crossed
with lines of black; eyebrow, sides of face, and sides of the neck
tawny-buff, the eyebrow uniform except on the under edge, where the
feathers are barred with black; ear-coverts scarcely marked at all,
but the plumes of the sides of the neck narrowly barred with black,
and elongated into a frill which covers the hind neck, the latter
being clothed in dense down of a tawny-buff-color; the feathers below
the eye, and a streak along the cheeks and down the sides of the neck,
black; malar line of feathers and throat creamy white, with a central
line of reddish buff feathers slightly mottled with black bases; the
lower throat also creamy white, with four or five tolerably defined
broad lines of tawny-buff and black-mottled feathers; the lower part of
the ruff on the fore neck with narrow wavy lines of black; the breast
covered with down of a tawny-buff-color, and hidden by a large patch
of loose plumes on each side of the chest, which are mostly black
with tawny-buff margins; remainder of under surface creamy white,
streaked with black centers to the feathers, the black markings
slightly broken up with mottlings of tawny-buff; thighs and under
tail-coverts with scarcely any markings whatever; under wing-coverts
and axillars tawny-buff, the former narrowly lined with blackish, the
axillars more distinctly barred with dusky blackish. 'Bill greenish
yellow; legs and feet yellowish green; claws dark brown; iris yellow;
bare space before the eye yellowish green.' (Seebohm.) Length, about
610; culmen, 69; wing, 330; tail 112; tarsus, 96.

"Two of the three specimens collected by Mr. Robert Bergman at Yokohama
are apparently young birds and have the primary-coverts and quills
almost uniform, with a certain amount of rufous mottlings confined
to the inner webs; in this state of plumage B. stellaris has a great
resemblance to B. poeciloptilus but is always to be distinguished
from the last-named bird by the tawny-colored frill on the sides of
the neck, instead of the smoky brown one peculiar to the Australian
bird." (Sharpe.)

A male collected near Anao, Tarlac Province, Luzon, March 14, 1904,
measured, 290 in length; wing, 165; tail, 68; culmen from frontal
feathers, 21; tarsus, 27; middle toe with claw, 42. A female from
the same locality and of the same date measured: Length, 290; wing,

"The eggs of the Indian dwarf goose, or 'cotton teal,' are generally
truly elliptical in form, occasionally compressed at the smaller end,
very smooth and glossy, and cream-color. They measure from 39 to 44
in length and from 30 to 35 in breadth." (Oates.)

This little bird is the only species of goose so far recorded from
the Islands; it occurs on the Laguna de Bay and a few specimens
were secured in Tarlac Province, Luzon. Oates lists three eggs of
this species as having been collected in Siquijor by the Steere
Expedition but Steere does not mention the species. A large goose
has been reported as occurring in the northern part of Luzon but no
specimen has been taken.

A male from Sevilla, Bohol, March 22, 1906, measures: Length, 424;
wing, 188; tail, 56; exposed culmen, 41; tarsus, 45; middle toe with
claw, 71.

A female of the same locality and date measures: Length, 424; wing,
175; tail, 58; exposed culmen, 42; tarsus, 46; middle toe with

A young bird from Taguig, Laguna de Bay, January 12, 1902, (length of
skin 305 mm.) has upper parts covered with dark gray down and lower
parts covered with white down; on crown, scapulars, breast, sides,

"The eggs of the wandering tree duck in the collection are almost
elliptical in shape, one end being very slightly compressed. They
are cream-colored and have a fair amount of gloss. Four specimens
measure respectively: 52 by 38; 48.2 by 35.5; 47.4 by 38; 48.2 by
36.3." (Oates.)

"Common in favorable localities throughout the islands. Frequently met
with in very large flocks. Found breeding in the Island of Siquijor
in the month of February." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

This tree duck is usually found in large flocks on lakes and
fresh-water marsh-land. When flushed the flock circles about and
generally the birds can be killed without the precautions which are
usually necessary in duck-shooting. A hard-shelled egg was taken from
a bird killed on the Laguna de Bay in January. Oates records two eggs
collected by Moseley in May.

other suitable localities.

"We found this fine mallard to be rare in all the localities visited by
us with the single exception of the region about the town of Milagros,
on the west coast of the Island of Masbate. In the last-mentioned
district it was very abundant, occurring in great flocks." (Bourns

256; middle tail-feathers, 114 to 127; culmen, 46 to 53; tarsus, 42.

"'Young in first plumage closely resembles adult females, but young
males may always be distinguished by having an alar speculum.

"'Males in first nuptial plumage have pale margins to the wing-coverts,
and most of the feathers of the rump are broadly barred, instead of
finely vermiculated, with white.

"'Adult males in molting plumage may be distinguished from adult
females by having an alar speculum, and being richer and darker
in color.

"'Young in down have the same pale spots on the upper parts as those
of the mallard, but the white on the throat and belly is slightly
suffused with gray instead of buff, and in addition to the dark lines
passing through the eye, a second dark line passes from the lores
below the eye to the nape.' (Seebohm.)

"According to some ornithologists, European specimens differ very
appreciably from North American in having a narrower speculum,
but I have failed to find that there is any appreciable
difference." (Salvadori.)

"Found in very large flocks on Manila Bay during January and February
but wild and difficult to kill." (Worcester.)



Genus QUERQUEDULA Oken, 1817.


This genus is very much like Nettion but the bill is broader, and
instead of being of the same width throughout, is wider toward the tip;
the nail also is broader.



162. QUERQUEDULA QUERQUEDULA (Linnæus).

ASIATIC BLUE-WINGED TEAL.

    Calayan (McGregor); Luzon (McGregor). Northern Europe and northern
    Asia, wintering in northeastern Africa, Indian Peninsula, China,
    and Malay Archipelago.


"Adult male.--Upper part of head and occiput brown-black; from above
eyes, on each side of head, a whitish band, extending to the sides
of occiput; sides of head and upper part of neck chocolate-brown,
streaked with white; chin black; back, rump, and upper tail-coverts
blackish, each feather edged with grayish olive; scapulars elongated
and pointed, black, with a central stripe of white; breast with brown
and black crescentic bands, producing a scaly-like appearance; lower
breast white; abdomen, sides, and flanks white, waved with narrow
blue lines; longer feathers of the flanks bounded by a subapical white
band, and a bluish gray band at the tip; sides of the rump and under
tail-coverts whitish, with black spots; upper wing-coverts and outer
scapulars bluish gray; wing-speculum on the secondaries glossy green,
bounded anteriorly by a white band formed by the greater wing-coverts,
and posteriorly by another white band at the tip of the secondaries;
primaries and tail-feathers brown, the latter edged with whitish;
under wing-coverts dark gray, the central ones, like the axillars,
white. Bill black, iris hazel; legs, toes, and their membranes grayish
brown. Length, about 406; wing, 197; tail, 70; culmen, 41; tarsus, 30.

"Young in first plumage resemble the females, but are darker and more
suffused with rufous on the breast.

"'Adult males in molting plumage closely resemble adult females,
but are darker in color, and may be distinguished by the brighter
alar speculum.' (Seebohm.)

"'Downy nestling resembles that of the mallard, but it is smaller,
and has a broad unbroken buff streak above the eye, and a well-defined
dark streak through the eye.' (Yarrell.)" (Salvadori.)

In immature plumage this species is likely to be confounded with
Nettion crecca and must be determined with care. The adult males of
the two species are very different.



Genus SPATULA Boie, 1822.


This genus is characterized by the peculiar bill which is twice as
wide near the tip as at the base; sides of upper mandible turned
under near tip.

the feathers with pale edges; ramp and upper tail-coverts black
glossed with green; lower breast and abdomen rich chestnut; flanks,
vent, and thighs paler, freckled with brown; under tail-coverts black,
glossed with green; a white patch on the lower flanks at the base of
the tail; upper wing-coverts and the outer web of two of the longer
scapulars pale blue; remainder of the scapulars black, all with a broad
silky white stripe along the middle; last row of wing-coverts tipped
with white, forming a band, which borders anteriorly the glossy green
wing-speculum; tip of the secondaries and the primaries brown; under
wing-coverts and axillars white; tail mostly white, freckled with
brown-gray, central feathers brown, edged with white. Iris yellow;
bill lead-color; feet reddish orange. Length, about 508; wing, 260;
tail, 95; culmen, 70; tarsus, 35.

"Female.--Upper parts brown, each feather with a broad reddish margin;
throat reddish immaculate; feathers of back and scapulars with reddish
bars, more or less crescentic; under parts reddish buff, each feather
brown in the central part, especially those of breast and flanks;

base of the maxilla and the entire mandible orange; iris hazel-brown;
feet dull orange.

"Male in first plumage resembles the female, but the wings are brighter
colored. Bill pale reddish brown; legs and feet flesh-color.

"Males in their first nuptial plumage have the white of the breast with
a few dark crescentic bands, the lower belly with dark bars, and the
rich black of the under tail-coverts mottled with chestnut and white.

"Adult male in molting plumage may be distinguished from the adult
female by the greater brilliancy of the blue and metallic green on
the wing, the plain dark upper tail-coverts, and the general darker
color of the entire plumage; the crown is dark brown.

"Young in down resemble those of the wigeon in having the upper parts
almost uniform, with indistinct pale spots, but they possess the
dark brown stripe through the eye as in the young mallard. The bill
is not widened at the tip, but it grows very rapidly." (Salvadori.)

This duck may be recognized in any plumage by the shape of its bill.



Subfamily MARILINÆ.



Genus MARILA Oken, 1817.


The members of this subfamily and genus differ from all other
Philippine ducks in having a tuft of long feathers springing from
the crown; the bill also is characteristic being short and wide and
slightly wider at tip than at base.

The tufted duck visits the Philippine Islands during the winter months
and at times may be found in large numbers; from Laguna de Bay, many
live ducks are brought to the Manila markets, the present species
ranking next in numbers to the common Dendrocygna arcuata.



Order PELECANIFORMES.

    Hand-List (1899), 1, 232; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 39.

    Ca-sí-li, Manila, also applied to the darter.

    Calayan (McGregor); Luzon (McGregor); Ticao (McGregor). Europe,
    Africa, northern Asia, Greenland; eastern North America south to
    Georgia; Indian Peninsula to China and Australia.


Adult in breeding plumage.--Almost entirely black, with a slight
oil-green gloss on neck and under parts; chin dirty white, this color
continued backward and upward on each side of neck to back of eye,
forming a border, 20 mm. wide, to the gular pouch and naked skin below
eye; entire crown, nape, neck on all sides, and throat decorated with
long, narrow, soft, white plumes which hide most of the short black
feathers; crest glossy black, narrow and about 40 mm. long; each flank
decorated with a large patch of long, soft, white feathers; upper back,
scapulars, and wing-coverts dull bronze-brown, each feather widely
bordered with dark bluish green or with glossy black; quills brownish
black; secondaries washed with greenish; tail and its coverts black.

Grant gives the following colors and measurements: "Iris bright
emerald-green; naked skin round eye greenish brown; below the eye and
on gular sack lemon-yellow; bill grayish brown; dusky along culmen
and yellowish white toward base; legs and feet blackish. Length,
about 914; culmen, 58 to 81; wing, 317 to 356; tail, 173 to 183;
tarsus, 58 to 72."

Adult in non-breeding plumage.--Similar to the above but without the
elongated feathers on head, neck, throat, and flanks.

"Young when first hatched are blind and covered with purplish black
skin; in the course of a few days they acquire a thick covering of
blackish down.

"Young in first plumage (September).--General color above dull brown,
somewhat glossed on head, neck, and back with bluish green; feathers
of back, scapulars, and wing-coverts with wide dark margins; throat,
front of neck, breast and belly white; sides, flanks, thighs, and
under tail-coverts dark brownish black. As age advances the fore part
of neck and chest become brown.

"Plumage of the second year (September).--Upper parts more like those
of the adult, but the plumage is less brilliant and mixed here and
there with feathers of the first plumage; feathers of the breast and
belly are all widely tipped with brownish black, giving these parts
a mottled appearance.

"Plumage of the third year (May).--Similar to the adult, but the color
of upper parts is less brilliant, and the under parts are not of such
a rich glossy black. Birds of this age (probably about 26 months
old), though they do not breed, assume a partial breeding-plumage;
the hair-like feathers on the head and neck being indicated, while
the white flank patches are partially acquired." (Grant.)

The cormorant appears to be somewhat rare in the Philippines but it
will perhaps be found breeding in some of the extensive marsh-lands
of central Luzon. A fully adult male in breeding plumage, taken in
Tarlac Province, yields the following data: Iris bright sea-green;
small spots of bright blue along edges of eyelids and below eye; bare
skin below eye bright yellow with a slight orange tinge, this yellow
extending to behind angle of mouth and onto base of lower mandible;
entire gular pouch dark, almost blackish brown, closely covered with
yellow spots; a small area just back of angle of gonys solid yellow;
upper mandible blackish brown; lower mandible white with terminal
third dusky brown; legs and nails black. Length, 850; wing, 345;
tail, 180; culmen, 66; tarsus, 60; middle toe with claw, 85.



Family ANHINGIDÆ.

    Negros (Layard). Mesopotamia, Indian Peninsula, Indo-Chinese
    countries, Indo-Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Celebes.


"Adult male.--Chin, throat, and upper part of fore neck mottled with
white; a narrow white line, about 125 mm. long, commencing above
gape and continued down sides of neck; head and neck brown, darker
and slightly glossed on the crown and along the back of the neck,
paler down the middle of fore neck, each feather being margined with
pale brown and giving the whole a finely scaled appearance; upper
back brownish black, each feather narrowly margined with rufescent
and streaked with white on the lateral parts; rest of back, rump,
lower part of fore neck, and under parts black with an oil-green gloss;
wing-coverts, scapulars, and innermost secondaries black, each with a
long, silvery white streak down the middle; scapulars much elongated
and pointed, the longest measuring about 230 mm.; innermost secondary
transversely ribbed along the basal two-thirds of outer web; quills
and tail black, the middle pair of tail-feathers strongly ribbed on
outer web and outer pairs slightly rayed. Tail composed of twelve
feathers. 'Iris yellow; bill dusky on culmen, yellowish on sides and
on lower mandible; legs black.' (Godwin-Austen.) Length, about 890;
culmen, from feathers on forehead, 89 to 91; wing, 330 to 355; tail,
218 to 230; tarsus, 43; outer toe with claw, 81.

"The fully adult female (if the sex of several specimens in the
British Museum is correctly determined) appears to be perfectly
similar in plumage to the male, the only difference being that the
bill is decidedly shorter, 79 to 81 mm. In some females, however,
which appear to be perfectly adult, the black bases of the fore neck
and the chest are divided on either side from the back by a whitish
buff band, as in immature birds.

"Immature birds.--General color as in the adult, but neck much lighter
and of a pale brownish white, becoming white down the middle of the
fore neck; black at base of fore neck and chest bordered on each
side by a whitish buff band; streaks on the upper plumage of a more
yellowish white, long pointed scapulars absent or half developed;
quills and tail-feathers pointed and narrowly margined at the tips with
pale whitish brown; ribs on innermost scapulars and tail-feathers but
slightly indicated; back, rump, and upper tail-coverts brownish black.

"Young in down.--Head, neck, upper back, and under parts covered with
white down, amongst which the plumage of the immature is more or less
visible; quill- and tail-feathers half grown, pointed and narrowly
margined at the extremity with pale brownish white; scapulars and
wing-coverts much like those of the adult, but fringed externally
with brown. Length, 724." (Grant.)

"Exceedingly abundant about Lake Naujan in Mindoro, where it
breeds. Rarer about fresh-water streams in the interior of that
island. Not met with by us outside of Mindoro.

"Always swims with its body entirely immersed, and can remain
under water an incredibly long time. Flies with difficulty when it
first rises from water. Makes straight for some good roosting place,
preferably a stump or log in the edge of the water, where it alights,
turns its back to the sun, spreads its wings, and remains until
thoroughly dry. When dry it flies rapidly, and may often be seen
during the heat of the day soaring at a considerable height." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

"Very abundant on the upper waters of the Rio Grande de Cagayan in
Isabela Province, and on the upper Agusan River and its lake system
in Mindanao." (Worcester.)

The Indian darter is fairly abundant along the Baco River in Mindoro
and on the Cagayan River in the vicinity of Aparri, Luzon. Clemens
collected specimens on Lake Lanao, Mindanao.

"Adult.--General color pure white; primaries, primary-coverts,
outer webs and tips of secondaries, and secondary-coverts hoary gray,
inclining to blackish on outermost quills in freshly molted birds, and
to blackish in worn specimens; chin and upper part of throat naked,
the feathers ending in a straight line across throat; tail composed
of fourteen, or sometimes sixteen feathers. Iris gray; bill grayish
blue, shading into pink or reddish toward the base; naked skin round
eye blue; gular pouch dark slate or black; legs and feet vermilion,
red or dark pink, almost magenta.

"Adult male.--Length, about 750; culmen from feathers on forehead,
89; wing, 394; tail, 10 to 28; tarsus, 35.

"Adult female.--Length, about 710; culmen from feathers on forehead,
81 to 88; wing, 373 to 375; tail, 208 to 210; tarsus, 35.

"Immature in first plumage.--Entire plumage above and below brown,
lighter on breast and belly; primaries and secondaries and their
coverts like those of the adult, but the inner webs of the secondaries
black. Cutting edges of the mandible sometimes serrated, and the inner
margin of the middle claw pectinate. Bill bluish pink, the latter
predominating toward the base; naked skin round eye dark leaden hue;
gular pouch flesh-colored.

"More adult specimens (perhaps in the plumage of the second year)
head, neck, and under parts white; back, wings, and tail brown as in
the immature; middle tail-feathers dark, brownish gray toward the base,
shading into white toward the extremity.

"A still more adult bird has a large amount of white or partially
white feathers mixed with the brown of the back and wings.

"I should imagine that the fully adult plumage is not attained until
the third or perhaps the fourth year. This species may be recognized
in all stages of plumage by the hoary gray appearance on the outer
webs of the quills." (Grant.)

"Adult.--Head, neck, chest, entire upper parts, wings, and tail dark
sooty brown; breast, rest of the under parts, axillars and under
wing-coverts of the secondaries pure white. Tail composed of 14
feathers. Iris silvery white, white, or gray; bill whitish green or
greenish blue, becoming flesh-colored or bluish at the base; naked skin
on sides of face and gular pouch bluish, greenish, or yellowish; legs
and feet pale green or lead-green, sometimes inclining to yellowish.

"Adult male.--Length, about 711; culmen from feathers on forehead,
100; wing, 389 to 396; tail, 190 to 195; tarsus, 46 to 48.

"Adult female.--Length, about 711; culmen from feathers on forehead,
100; wing, 389 to 396; tail, 190 to 195; tarsus, 46 to 48.

"Immature in first plumage.--Differs in having the head, neck, chest,
entire upper parts, wings and tail brown, much lighter than in the
adult; breast, belly, and under parts still paler brown, the feathers
fringed with whitish brown, and generally sharply defined from the
darker chest; axillars and secondary under wing-coverts mixed with
smoky brown.

"More mature birds (? plumage of the second year).--Breast, belly,
and under parts largely mixed with white, only the subterminal portion
of each feather smoky brown.

"Still more mature bird (? plumage of the third year).--Head, neck,
chest, and upper parts darker brown, and more like those of the adult;
the breast and belly thickly mixed with the pure white feathers of the
adult. These appear to be entirely attained by molt, many half-grown
ones being concealed beneath the plumage." (Grant.)

This gannet is quite abundant about the small islands north of Luzon
and it probably finds nesting places on some of the more isolated
rocks. Gannets lay their chalky white eggs in the sand or construct
flat nests of sticks which they place in bushes or trees. One or two
eggs are deposited in a nest.



Family FREGATIDÆ.


Bill long and strongly hooked, both mandibles decurved at tip; lateral
grooves deep; nostrils situated in the grooves and practically closed;
a large naked and brightly colored gular pouch; wings pointed and
extremely long; first primary longest; tail long and very deeply
forked; feet absurdly small and weak for so large a bird; claw of
middle toe pectinate; tarsus very short; plumage black with beautiful
green and purple gloss.

"Adult male.--General color black, becoming sooty below; feathers of
head, upper back, and scapulars elongate and pointed; head with slight
oil-green gloss; scapulars strongly glossed with bronze-green, this
color changing to purple when specimen is held away from the light;
a trace of green and purple gloss on breast and sides. Iris brown;
bill black except the tip which is horn-gray; gular pouch dark crimson;
feet blackish brown, flesh-colored below; webs bluish below; nails
brown. Extent of wings, 1,830; length of bird, 914; wing, 600; tail,
410; depth of fork, 240; culmen from base, 105; tarsus, 20. Grant
gives the following measurements: Length, about 1,016; culmen, from
feathers on forehead, 91 to 112; wing, 521 to 655; tail, 355 to 376;
tarsus, 18."

"Adult female.--Feathers of head less elongate than in the male and
with little or no gloss; upper back and scapulars slightly elongate
and almost devoid of metallic gloss; back of head dark brown;
fore neck, chest, breast, and sides of belly pure white; lesser and
median wing-coverts brown, with paler margins and dark middles; rest
of plumage like that of adult male. Iris dark brown; bill bluish
horn-color; orbits and gular skin dark plumbeous, with a tinge of
violet; feet carmine. Length, 582 to 678; tail, 373 to 483; tarsus, 25.

"Male and female immature.--Head, neck, upper part of chest, and
middle of lower breast and belly, white; sides and upper breast dark
sooty brown; rest of plumage like adult female. Iris dull dark blue;
naked skin on throat lavender, bill horn-color, darker at base;
feet pale pinkish blue." (Grant.)

"The eggs of the great frigate bird measure from 59 to 72 mm. in
length and from 42 to 51 in breadth." (Oates.) The eggs are white
and covered with more or less chalk-like substance.

The frigate pelicans are preëminently soaring birds of wonderful
power. In these Islands they are rarely seen, and far more rarely
killed, as they usually fly at great heights. During the nesting season
they are fearless and may be observed near at hand. The larger species,
at least, may nest on some of the more remote and rocky islands of
this Archipelago.

"Adult male.--General color black, inclining to sooty black on
under parts; feathers of head, upper back, and scapulars elongate
and pointed, the former with a dull oil-green gloss, the latter dark
metallic-green in freshly molted specimens, but becoming bronze or
purple with wear; a large white patch on each flank. Tail composed of
12 feathers. Iris black; naked skin round eye and gular pouch red;
bill gray; feet black. Length, about 760; culmen from feathers on
forehead, 58 to 89; wing, 487 to 533; tail, 279 to 338; tarsus, 19.

"Adult female.--Head like that of the male, but feathers of the
back and scapulars less elongate and of a brownish black color with
scarcely a trace of metallic gloss; breast, sides of belly, flanks,
and a wide collar round the neck white; lesser and median wing-coverts
pale brown, with whitish margins and deep brown shaft-stripes; plumage
otherwise like that of the male. Iris red; bill gray; bare skin round
the eye and on the throat red, but not so light as that of the male;
feet red. Length, about 760; culmen from feathers on forehead, 81 to
91; wing, 510 to 528; tail, 287 to 343; tarsus, 18.

"Male and female immature.--Head and neck white, shading into brown
on the chest, breast, sides of belly, lower neck, and upper parts;
middle of belly and flanks white. It will thus be seen that the colors
of the above parts are just the reverse of those of the adult female,
the white parts being dark and vice versa; rest of the plumage much
like that of the adult female. Iris black; bill and feet whitish with
a shade of blue." (Grant.)

"Not infrequently seen singly or in small flocks, but very difficult
to kill." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Family PELECANIDÆ.


Body large and heavy; upper mandible depressed, narrower and higher
at base, broader and flattened toward the end, composed of a median
bar, continuing the whole length of the bill and terminating in a
strongly hooked nail, and of two lateral portions each separated from
the median bar by a very narrow groove, in the basal part of which
the small nostril opens; lower mandible thin, of two flexible arches
supporting a large pouch of naked membrane.

"Adult in breeding plumage.--(September to February). General
color pure white; forehead, top of head, fairly long crest, cheeks,
and neck covered with dense curly, very soft, pure white feathers,
with their black bases more or less visible; hind neck, from crest to
upper back, covered with soft grayish brown feathers, forming a mane;
upper back, scapulars, and wing-coverts white, tinged, especially
on the lesser wing-coverts, with cream-color; winglet, primaries,
and primary-coverts brownish black, with the upper surface of the
shafts dark; secondaries grayish brown, paler on the outer web and
shading into brownish gray on innermost secondaries; an interscapular
line down the middle of upper back; lower back, rump, flanks, under
tail-coverts, axillars, and under wing-coverts vinaceous; rest of
under parts pure white, chest and upper breast tinged with yellow;
tail-feathers ashy, paler toward the tips and with dark shafts. Tail
composed of 22 feathers. 'Bill pinkish yellow, the lateral portions
of the upper mandible with large bluish black spots; the nail and
terminal halves of both mandibles orange-yellow; central portions of
sides of lower mandible smeared with bluish black; pouch dull purple,
blotched and spotted with bluish black; eyelids and skin round eye
orange-yellow; skin in front of eye livid; legs and feet very dark
brown; claws yellowish horn; iris stone-white, varying to pale yellow,
clouded with brown.' (Oates.) Length, 1,295 to 1,500; culmen, 320 to
368; wing, 558 to 610; tail, 203 to 421; tarsus, 84 to 96. The female
is somewhat smaller than the male, but not conspicuously so.

"Adult in non-breeding plumage (March-August).--Plumage similar to
that of the young after the first molt.

"Nestling.--Covered with white down; iris dark brown; bill pale
plumbeous; legs china-white; pouch pale bluish white. The down on the
wings soon turns to pale rufous; and the scapulars, when they appear,
are brown, edged with ferruginous; the wing-coverts, on making their
appearance, are furnished with a dense fringe of rufous down, which,
however, soon falls off, leaving the feathers with rufous margins;
the scapulars are developed very rapidly, and their ferruginous
margins are diminished in extent as the bird grows; the down on the
head and neck gives place to brownish feathers, and the crest and
loose feathers of the mane on the hind neck soon make their appearance.

"The young bird, when fully fledged, retains its first feathers
for at least one year, the only change being that the brown colors
become darker and the rufous edgings abraded and consequently less
marked. The impressed spots on the bill are not indicated till the
sixth month, and even at the end of twelve months these spots are
quite indistinct, compared with those of the adult bird. Toward the
end of the first year a livid spot appears in front of the eyes and
soon becomes clearly defined. The nail and the terminal third of the
edges of the bill are yellow, legs and toes flesh-color.

"After the first molt, at about twelve months of age, the whole head
and neck are covered with short, soft, downy feathers, the bases of
which are black, the tips white; and the crest and mane are developed
to the same extent as in the adult; the shoulders and scapulars
are wood-brown; the lesser and median coverts to the secondaries
wood-brown; the feathers all edged with paler; the greater coverts
darker brown, edged with light brown; the coverts to the tertiaries
grayish brown, edged with pale fulvous. The whole of the coverts
narrow and sharp-pointed; the winglet, primaries, and their coverts
dark brown; the secondaries brown, tinged with ashy on the outer webs;
the whole back, rump, upper tail-coverts, and flanks white; the lower
plumage whitish brown, each feather being white with the tip brownish,
the feathers close, dense, and soft.

"In June of the third year, or when the bird is about thirty months
old, the molt into adult breeding plumage is commenced and the
change is entirely effected by October, except that in this first
breeding season the wing-coverts never become entirely white as
in the old birds, the feathers of these parts being a mixture of
long sharp-pointed, white feathers, and comparatively blunt brown
ones. Between June and October the pouch, which has hitherto been
spotless, becomes blotched with livid as in the adults, the blotches
extending to the face; the legs turn to dark brown; the iris becomes
paler brown; and the spots on the bill become firm and well defined.

"Mr. E. W. Oates, having kept large numbers of P. philippensis
in confinement, has had exceptional opportunities of studying the
changes of plumage, and the above descriptions are the results of
his observations, published in his Birds of British Burmah." (Grant.)

"We were informed that pelicans were abundant on the Laguna de Bay
at certain seasons, but when we were there none were to be found. A
number of specimens are preserved in the Jesuit Museum at Manila,
and several live birds were to be seen there on different occasions
when we visited the Museum. Padre Sanchez kindly offered us specimens,
and we intended to accept his offer at a later date, but unforeseen
circumstances prevented our doing so." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Abundant about fish-breeding ponds in tide-water marshes of Bulacan
in February, 1904. Also at Anao, Tarlac Province, in same month and
year. Fairly common in the Candaba swamp, Luzon." (Worcester.)

much curved, end of bill hooked and its tip perpendicular; basal
portion of bill covered by a membrane or cere, in which the nostrils
are situated; legs large; feet very strong, claws curved and sharp;
general plumage compact; wings long and powerful; tail nearly square,
rarely forked or wedge-shaped.

Genus CIRCUS Lacépède, 1799.


Bill moderate or weak, somewhat compressed; margin of upper mandible
slightly sinuate but not toothed; wing very long and pointed, first
primary short, about equal to sixth; secondaries much shorter than
primaries; tail long, slightly graduated or nearly square; tarsus
long and slender, feathered at the base and overhung for about
half its length by the long thigh-feathers; front of tarsus with
transverse plates, sides and most of the hinder aspect with hexagonal
scales; toes long, nails long and much curved; behind ear-coverts and
sometimes across the throat a "ruff" of short, rather stiff feathers,
most conspicuous in the young of melanoleucos and not very evident
in the other species.

The harriers or marsh hawks are noticeable among birds of prey
for their slender form, long slender legs, and slow flight. Adult
birds can be easily identified but the immature specimens present
considerable difficulty.

    Indo-Burmese countries, and Malay Archipelago.


Adult male.--Above black, nape and hind neck narrowly streaked with
white; feathers of lower back and rump tipped with ashy gray or white;
sides of head and ear-coverts black; lower parts white; chin, throat,
and breast with bold black shaft-streaks; primaries black, white for

Luzon, measures, 520 in length; wing, 410; tail, 230; culmen from base,
33; tarsus, 92; middle toe with claw, 63.

Younger male.--Color pattern similar; upper parts brown; white streaks
on head and neck more numerous; under parts white with wider streaks of
reddish brown which are also present on flanks and abdomen; primaries
black, some of them barred with ashy white; wing-coverts brown with
less white than the adult; primary-coverts and alula ashy white but
with blackish brown bars; under wing-coverts white, streaked with
blackish brown; axillars white, streaked and barred with reddish
brown. Length, 533; wing, 400; tail, 235; culmen from base, 32;
tarsus, 80; middle toe with claw, 61.

"Adult female.--Above brown slightly shaded with ashy, the dorsal
feathers obsoletely margined with dull rufous; crown and hind neck
tawny-buff, paler on the neck, all the feathers mesially streaked
with brown; scapulars and wing-coverts margined and barred with tawny
or fulvous, the least wing-coverts more conspicuously margined with
rufous; quills brown, narrowly tipped with whitish, externally shaded
with ashy gray, the secondaries less distinctly, and all barred across
with darker brown; under surface of wing white, the dark bars showing
very distinctly; lower back and rump brown, the feathers distinctly
tipped with pale rufous; upper tail-coverts pure white; tail ashy
gray, tipped with fulvous and crossed with five blackish bands, the
subterminal one much the broadest, the ashy gray interspaces inclining

"Adult female.--Brown above, the feathers throughout with pale
rufous edges; tail-coverts white and rufous; tail with about six dark
cross-bands, which disappear in old individuals; lower parts buff,
with broad rufous-brown shaft-stripes. The quills are dark brown but
become grayish in old birds.

"Young birds so closely resemble those of C. æruginosus as to be
indistinguishable at times. The pale head and neck-feathers are
always striated in C. spilonotus, but the body, wings, and tail are
uniform brown or variegated with buff on the wing-coverts, back,
and breast. Generally, though not invariably, traces of bars will
be found on some of the tail-feathers of C. spilonotus, but this
occasionally happens in C. æruginosus also.

"Length, of male, 508; tail, 235; wing, 394; tarsus, 89; tail of
female, 254; wing, 419; tarsus, 94." (Blanford.)

    (McGregor). Eastern Siberia and Mongolia; in winter to China,
    northeastern Indian Peninsula, and Indo-Chinese countries.


"Adult male.--Upper parts glossy black; rump and upper tail-coverts
white, the latter with two or three broad cross-bars of black or ashy
gray, the former also shaded with gray; wing-coverts silvery gray,
margined with white, with a broad band of black feathers extending
from the bend of wing parallel with its margin and joining the median
coverts, which are also black; primaries black; primary-coverts and
secondaries silvery gray, except the innermost, which are black;
tail entirely silvery gray, tipped with white, below and on the inner
webs white; sides of face and neck, throat, and chest glossy black;
rest of under surface, including under wing- and tail-coverts, pure
white. Bill and cere black; feet yellow; iris yellow. Length, 457;
culmen, 25; wing, 356; tail, 216; tarsus, 76." (Sharpe.)

"Adult female.--Above dark brown, the feathers of the crown and neck
with rufous edges, those of the nape broadly bordered with white;
a well-marked ruff of small white or buffy white feathers with brown
shaft-stripes; around eyes whitish; cheeks and ear-coverts dirty white
or pale rufous with brown streaks; smaller coverts along forearm white
(in younger birds rufous) with blackish brown shaft-stripes, median
coverts brown with gray or white spots and bars, larger coverts dusky
gray with a broad subterminal blackish band and another near the base;
primaries outside blackish brown; secondaries gray, with blackish
cross-bands, beneath all are grayish or whitish with dark bands;
upper tail-coverts white, sometimes with rufous-brown drops or bands;
tail gray with dark brown cross-bands; lower parts white, with dark
brown shaft-stripes, broad on the throat and breast, narrower and
sometimes disappearing on the abdomen.

"Young birds are more uniform brown above than the adult female,
and have no gray on the wings or tail, which are brown with darker
bands; the ruff is ill-marked at the sides, but there is a large white
brown-streaked nuchal patch and another patch of buff-edged brown
feathers on the throat; the lower parts generally are rufous-brown,
faintly streaked darker.

"For a long time it was supposed that both sexes in this bird were
pied and similar, but the true facts were gradually traced out by
Mr. Hume. Still one undoubted case is recorded by Mr. Cripps in which
a female assumed the pied livery of the adult male, and other probable
cases are indicated by the measurements of pied specimens. Length of
male, 432; tail, 216; wing, 349; tarsus, 76; length of female, 470;
tail, 228; wing, 368; tarsus, 81; bill from gape, 30." (Blanford.)

The adult male of the pied marsh hawk is a very beautiful and graceful
bird; the female and young are dull brown and unattractive. This
species is fairly abundant in the lowlands where it frequents open

EUROPEAN MARSH HAWK.


    Falco æruginosus Linnæus, Syst. Nat. ed. 10 (1758), 1, 91.
    Circus æruginosus Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1874), 1, 69;
    Hand-List (1899), 1, 246; Blanford, Fauna Brit. India Bds. (1895),
    3, 387; Grant, Ibis (1895), 438; Oates, Cat. Birds' Eggs (1902),
    2, 239; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 41.

    Cagayan Sulu (Mearns); Luzon (Whitehead); Mindoro
    (Everett). Temperate Europe and Siberia; in winter to northern
    Africa, Indian Peninsula, and China.


"Adult male.--Head, neck, and breast buff or pale rufous, with dark
brown shaft-stripes, broader on the breast; back and most of the
wing-coverts dark brown; scapulars still darker, sometimes gray toward
the base; smallest coverts along the forearm whitish, with dark brown
shafts; outer greater coverts, primary-coverts, and all quills except
first six primaries dark silvery gray, remaining coverts and very
often the tertiaries dark brown; first six primaries black with the
basal portion white; upper tail-coverts white with rufous and brown
mixed in various ways; tail gray above, isabelline below; abdomen
and lower tail-coverts ferruginous brown, more or less striped darker.

"Females are dark brown except the crown, nape, chin, and more or less
of the throat, which are buff with brown stripes. There is sometimes
a patch of buff on the breast, the wing-coverts and back have buff
edges, and the upper tail-coverts are rufous.

"The young of both sexes resemble the female, except that the buff
on the head is sometimes unstreaked and more limited in extent, being
confined in some cases to a nuchal patch or even wanting altogether.

"'Bill black; cere and base of bill greenish yellow; iris
yellow, brownish yellow in females and young; legs and feet rich
yellow.' (Hume.)

"Length of males, 533; tail, 241; wing, 406; tarsus, 86; length of
females, 572; tail, 248; wing, 419; tarsus, 89." (Blanford.)

The measurements given by Sharpe are as follows: "Male, length, 571;
culmen, 39; wing, 406; tail, 254; tarsus, 86. Female, length, 584;
wing, 432; tail, 279; tarsus, 96."

The young of Circus spilonotus and C. æruginosus are similar in
plumage and as the size is also nearly the same it is a matter of
some difficulty to distinguish between them. Sharpe identified
as C. æruginosus a young female collected in the Philippines by
Cuming, but he finally referred it to C. spilonotus. Whitehead
obtained an immature male in northern Luzon which according
to Grant "is undoubtedly referable to the present species
[æruginosus]." Concerning the specimen from Calayan Sulu, collected
by Mearns, Dr. Chas. W. Richmond writes that "it may prove to be
spilonotus." Hartert makes no comment on the specimen collected by
Everett in Mindoro.

Some of the numerous brown marsh hawks in the Bureau of Science
collection may be of this species but they can not be determined
at present.



Genus ASTUR Lacépède, 1799.


Bill small and compressed, upper mandible with a deep notch or a
strong sinuation near its tip; first primary short, third or fourth

    (part).

    Calayan (McGregor); Cebu (McGregor); Fuga (Whitehead); Mindanao
    (Koch & Schadenberg). Japan, northern China; in winter to Malay
    Peninsula and Malay Archipelago.


Adult.--Above including wings, blackish slate, the bases of the
feathers pure white with a tendency to show on the nape; ear-coverts
and sides of neck slaty gray, the feathers edged with rufous;
sides of face slate, lined with white; chin and throat white with
blackish shaft-lines; breast and sides vinous-chestnut; abdomen
and under tail-coverts white; quills blackish, inner webs white
basally; secondaries and inner primaries barred with blackish; under
wing-coverts and axillars pale ochraceous; tail ashy brown crossed
by five bars of blackish brown, seven bars on outermost pair. Male,
length, 273; wing, 190; tail, 124; culmen from base, 18; tarsus, 45;
middle toe with claw, 33. Female, length, 295; wing, 205; tail, 148;
culmen from base, 18; tarsus, 42; middle toe with claw, 34.

Immature.--Upper parts dark brown, most of the feathers edged with
rusty or earthy brown; under parts white with wide bars of light rusty
brown. This plumage is followed by one in which the under parts are
white with wide shaft-streaks of blackish brown. Specimens occur with
the fore breast streaked and the hind breast, sides, and flanks barred
and with individual feathers both barred and streaked. The acquisition
of adult plumage probably takes some time, two or three years.

The preceding descriptions are taken from birds collected in Calayan
Island and while none of them shows the complete adult plumage, one
specimen has the breast partly chestnut indicating the adult plumage.

Grant characterizes A. gularis as follows:

"Female adult.--Like A. nisus, being barred transversely up to the
throat, which is white, with a more or less well-marked dark line
down the middle, formed by the very narrow black or grayish-black
shaft-stripes to the feathers. Fourth primary quill longest and
considerably longer than the fifth.

"Male adult.--Throat white, the line of feathers down the middle
with black shafts, forming a very narrow black central line, absent
in the most adult examples. The fourth primary quill longest, and
considerably longer than the fifth."

Adult.--Above brown; head, neck, and mantle with an ashy blue wash,
basal portion of feathers white or with one or two large white spots;
back, rump, and tail-coverts brown without hidden white spots; sides
of head brown; chin and throat white with a narrow median brown line;

gray on distal part of inner webs and with ochraceous on basal part;
secondaries barred with ochraceous on inner webs; scapulars with two
or more large white spots, all concealed; axillars and wing-lining
faint ochraceous, barred with brown; tail brown, crossed by five
darker brown bars.

Male from Benguet, Luzon.--Length, 254; wing, 156; tail, 114; culmen
from base, 18; tarsus, 48; middle toe with claw, 35.

Female from Benguet, Luzon.--Bill black, bluish at base, cere
pea-green; iris and eyelids bright yellow; skin about eye and base
of bill dull green; nails very dark brown; legs and feet light
yellow. Length, 310; wing, 185; tail, 140; culmen from base, 20;

bluish ash; feathers of wings, mantle, rump, and upper tail-coverts
edged with rusty brown; median line on throat incomplete; breast and
abdomen white with very wide, seal-brown, shaft-stripes; sides and
flanks with some reddish brown cross-bars; thighs white, barred with
brown; wing-lining ochraceous with large blackish brown spots.

"Accipiter manillensis is, I think, subspecifically distinct from
typical A. virgatus, and Mr. Whitehead having, in addition to the
Museum series, now obtained three adult females, we have a fair number
of skins for comparison.

"Adult female.--Differs from the female of A. virgatus in having the
chest, breast, and sides nearly uniform light red in the most adult
birds, while in somewhat younger examples the middle of the breast
shows distinct cross-bars of reddish brown and white; the under
surface on the quills washed with rufous. Wing, 175 to 178; tail,
137 to 139; tarsus, 52 to 53.

"Adult male.--Like the male of A. virgatus. Wing, 152 to 155; tail,
122 to 124; tarsus, 51." Grant, Ibis, (1896), 109.

I have found considerable difficulty in identifying members
of the genus Accipiter from the Philippines and the preceding
descriptions will require revision when more specimens shall have
been collected. With some hesitation I have placed A. stephensoni as
a synonym under A. manillensis instead of under A. gularis.

    Worcester).


"The general color of the upper surface in this species is a dark
umber-brown; but the base of the feathers of the crest is white and
the margins of the other occipital feathers are of a light yellowish
brown. Some of the scapulars and other alar feathers (especially the
latter) are slightly tipped with the same; the tail, which is of a
somewhat lighter brown than the back, is tipped with a very narrow
edging of white, and is also crossed by seven blackish brown bars,
the upper one, however, being somewhat indistinct, and the two lower
being separated by an interval which is twice the breadth of the
spaces between the other bars. The throat has a broad blackish band
running down the center, with two similar and nearly parallel bands
proceeding from the corners of the mouth, the three bands all merging
in a cluster of dark brown lanceolate marks upon the upper portion
of the breast, the intervals between these markings, and also the
whole sternal and abdominal regions, being tinged with a yellowish
rufous; the under tail-coverts are barred with brown and white, the
former bars being much broader than the latter; and the thighs and
tarsi are marked throughout their length with narrow, equidistant,
transverse bars of the same color. Length, 635; crest, 63; wing, 375;
tail, 292; tarsus, 89; middle toe with claw, 76." (Sharpe.)

A rare species found only in forest. A male from Lubang measures:
Length, 610; wing, 390; tail, 250; culmen from base, 38; tarsus, 97.

"Adult.--Above and below deep chocolate-brown, inclining to blackish
on the head and back, the quills and tail blackish, the shafts of the
latter brownish, the inner webs of the quills clear ashy; tail-feathers
below ashy white, brownish toward the tips, the penultimate ones with
remains of irregular cross-markings. Cere yellowish; feet pale yellow;
iris bright yellow. Length, 635; culmen, 43; wing, 406; tail, 279;
tarsus, 104.

"Young (type of species).--Above clear brown, with faint terminal
margins of fulvous-brown, the buff-colored bases showing very
conspicuously on all the upper parts, but especially distinct on
the wing-coverts, which are also broadly margined with buffy white;
quills deep brown, the secondaries lighter and more purplish brown,
broadly tipped with buffy white, and indistinctly barred with darker
brown, plainer on the inner web, especially underneath, where it is
ashy white on the primaries and grayish on the secondaries; lower
back and rump pale brown, the upper tail-coverts brownish buff;
tail brown, tipped with buffy white and crossed with six equidistant
bands of darker brown; head and neck whitish buff, the sides of the
latter washed with sandy rufous, and mottled with dark brown in the
centers of the feathers; under surface of body buffy white, washed
with pale fawn-color on the sides of the body and thighs, with a few
indistinct spots of the same on the chest; under wing-coverts white,
spotted with dark brown, the spots larger on the greater series. Iris
brownish. Length, 610; wing, 394; tail (not fully grown), 241;
tarsus, 94.

"Another young bird, collected by Mr. Wallace, is rather larger in
general bulk than the foregoing example, though having the wing of
the same length. It is purer white below, with a shade of dark brown
on the lower flanks, and a few distinct oval spots of brown on the
breast. The center tail-feather has seven bands of dark brown.

"Nestling.--Covered with snow-white down, the crown of the head
inclining to fawn-color, the sprouting feathers blackish brown,
the greater wing-coverts tipped with white; the few breast-feathers
visible white, with broad blackish cross-bars." (Sharpe.)

    Leyte? (Whitehead); Luzon (Ickis); Mindanao (Keller, Clemens,
    Farrel); Samar (Whitehead, Bourns & Worcester).


"Top of head pale whitish buff with dark middles to the feathers,
which are rather narrow and pointed, especially those on the occiput,
which form a long full crest; general color above rich brown, most of
the feathers with paler margins, especially the quill-feathers and
wing-coverts; tail-feathers dark brown, the two median pairs with
wide dark bands; shafts of quills and tail-feathers creamy white;
under parts uniform creamy white; thighs and long flank-feathers with
reddish brown shaft-stripes. Length, about 840; bill, greatest depth
measured from base of cere to ridge of culmen, 38; from base of cere
to tip, 38; wing, 525; tail, 381; tarsus, 118; middle toe without
claw, 68; claw, measured in a straight line from base to tip, 37;
hind toe without claw, 46; claw, 51." (Grant.)

"Iris dull creamy brown, with an outer ring of brownish red, the two
colors melting into one another and not sharply defined; face and
base of bill dull french-blue, tip of bill black; legs and feet dull
yellow; claws black." (Whitehead.)

Grant's original description given above is quite sufficient to
identify this remarkable eagle, and agrees with a specimen before
me, but in at least two specimens which I have examined there were
conspicuous black shaft-lines on the feathers of chin and jaw. This
may have been due to a more adult plumage than the one described
by Grant. Respecting the size of this bird Grant says in part:
"The depth of the bill is greater than that of any known bird of
prey, except Pallas's sea eagle (Haliaëtus pelagicus), in which
it is sometimes a trifle greater, while such extreme narrowness,
compared with the depth, is quite unique in birds of this order. It
is also among some parrots, such as the black cockatoo (Microglossus
aterrimus), that we find a bill approaching this type, but in none
of these is it laterally compressed to the same extent. The high
vaulted nasal opening, set almost vertically, is another peculiar
character. The naked tarsi and feet approach those of the harpy eagle
(Thrasaëtes harpyia) in size and strength, and the scaling of the
tarsi is remarkably similar. Strange as it may seem, we have little
doubt that the harpy is the nearest known ally of the present species."

Measurements of several specimens have been given by me in the
Philippine Journal of Science and they need not be repeated here.



Genus SPILORNIS Gray, 1840.


Culmen straight to edge of cere, from there strongly curved to tip;
cutting edge of bill without notch or sinuation; a large nearly
naked space between eye and bill; occipital crest full; first primary

the feathers; upper surface of body brown, the wing-coverts with
a few minute spots of white on the margins of the feathers; quills
black, primary-coverts and secondaries narrowly tipped with white,
the primaries somewhat shaded with ashy gray externally and crossed
with two brown bands, one broad and very distinct, the other basal and
nearly obsolete, these bars less distinct above on the secondaries,
but rather plainer below; upper tail-coverts and tail blackish brown,
slightly tipped with whitish, the latter crossed with a broad median
band of pale ashy brown, with indications of a second basal one only
visible below; sides of head and throat blackish, cheeks somewhat
shaded with ashy gray; remainder of under surface of body brown, the
chest uniform, the breast with distinct oval spots of white on both
webs, more numerous on thighs and inclining to bars on flanks and

    Goodfellow); Mindoro (Steere Exp., Everett, Porter); Samar (Steere
    Exp., Bourns & Worcester); Sulu (Bourns & Worcester); Tawi Tawi
    (Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult.--Above pale brown with a purplish gloss and the feathers
irregularly spotted or margined with white at their tips; hind neck and
interscapulary region lighter than the rest of the back, the feathers
tipped with pale rufous, and ocellated with large rounded spots of
white; head much crested, ashy black, the feathers slightly margined
with rufous and spotted with white; sides of face and throat ashy gray,
the latter varied with oval markings of whitish; under surface of
body very light tawny, ocellated all over with spots or half bars of
white, the latter more distinct on the under tail-coverts; the thighs
and under wing-coverts a little darker and more thickly spotted with
white; wing-coverts dark brown, minutely spotted with white; primaries
brown, whitish on inner web, black at tip, and crossed with a black
bar about the middle of the feather; secondaries pale brown like the
back, with white tips and faint indications of obsolete whitish bars
on the feathers; upper tail-coverts brown, darker before the tips,
which are white, and having remains of rounded white spots concealed
or obscured by the brown color of the feathers; tail pale brown,
narrowly tipped with whity brown, and crossed with two broad bands
of blackish brown, one subterminal and the other about the middle of
the tail, a band of light brown before the lower black band, and a
broad band of whity brown between the two black bands. Length, 635;
culmen, 46; wing, 368; tail, 254; tarsus, 90.

"Young.--Above brown, the feathers tipped with pale rufous, the white
bases very conspicuous especially on the wing-coverts, which appear
lighter than the back; head, which is largely crested, and hind neck
rufous, the feathers buffy white at the base; with a chestnut-brown
subterminal spot; ear-coverts and sides of face uniform dark brown;
throat white; rest of under surface of body fulvous washed with
rufous, more especially on the breast-feathers, which have dark
brown shafts; under wing-coverts fulvous, washed with tawny rufous;
primaries dark brown, secondaries rather lighter like the back,
and tipped with buffy white, all the quills white at base of inner
web, and barred with darker brown, showing more plainly underneath,
as the interspaces are whitish ashy; tail brown, washed with rufous
near the base, and slightly tipped with fulvous, crossed with four
or five bars of dark brown, the basal ones indistinct and more or
less dissolved into mottlings." (Sharpe.)

From Cape Engaño we have received an immature female, which has the
head and upper mantle whitish buff, with brown shaft-spots; there is
the beginning of a short deep black superciliary band extending above
the eye, while a few feathers of a more adult plumage are beginning
to make their appearance on the occiput; these are brownish red,
with a white subterminal black tip. (The appearance of this black
eyebrow-stripe is very puzzling, as it does not appear in the adult
plumage; it may be part of an intermediate plumage or fade with age
and wear to the dark brown of the adult.) General color above brown,
with irregular, ill-defined reddish white spots on either web; tail
dark brown with two wide brownish white bands across the terminal half;
chin and throat whitish buff. Sides of the head and under parts pale
buff, with brownish red shaft-stripes, widest on the terminal half;
thighs buff, with wide chestnut middles, constricted at intervals,
so as to form ill-defined buff spots down the sides of the feathers,
one or two half grown adult feathers on the left thigh. Wing, 386;
tail, 272; tarsus, 86.

"Although somewhat peculiar in plumage and large in size, I have
no hesitation in referring this specimen to S. holospilus, and
Mr. Whitehead shares the same opinion." (Grant.)

"Adult male.--Head black, feathers of crest sulphur-white at base,
then black, narrowly edged with whitish; rest of upper surface with
wings light ashy brown, all the feathers edged with whitish. Tail
broadly tipped with white and with two broad whitish bars and part
of a third basal one; throat bluish ash, unmarked; rest of under
surface pale cinnamon, shaded with ash and spotted and banded
as in S. holospilus. Length, 502; wing, 317; tail, 229; tarsus,
71. Distinguished from S. holospilus by its small size and pale
coloring." (Steere.)

The validity of this species is somewhat doubtful. Bourns and Worcester
consider that it "was founded on differences due to change of season
and to individual variation." Grant thinks "that S. panayensis may
fairly be recognized as a distinct form."



Genus BUTASTUR Hodgson, 1843.


Bill small, its edge slightly sinuate; wings moderate, primaries
cut on inner web; first primary short; secondaries much shorter

or four broad bars of blackish brown, the lower surface ashy white,
the bars showing more plainly, except on the outermost feather, where
they are obsolete; throat white, with a mesial line of ashy brown,
as well as two not very distinct moustachial streaks; upper breast
ashy brown, washed with rufous, the lower breast and abdomen barred

Adult.--Entire head, neck, and lower parts white, many of the feathers
with blackish shafts; tail blackish, its terminal third white;
primaries blackish with white bases; axillars and wing-lining white;
remainder of wings and upper parts bluish slate-gray, with a slight
mixture of brown. Male from Ticao: Iris dark; bill at base and cere
horn-blue; bill at tip and nails black; legs and toes white. Length,
685; wing, 550; tail, 230; culmen from base, 52; tarsus, 91. The
female is said to be slightly larger.

Young.--Head, chin, and throat buffy or pale yellowish white, more
or less streaked with light brown; general color brown, darker above,
many of the feathers with lighter brown or whitish shaft-lines which
widen at the tips; primaries black with whitish bases; end of tail
brown, basal two-thirds white mottled with brown.

The white-breasted sea eagle is widely distributed but nowhere in the
Philippines is it abundant. In adult plumage it is easily identified
by its white under parts. Its nest consists of a mass of sticks and
is usually supported by the branches of some large tree. Islets on
which there are but a few trees are in particular favor with this
species. The eggs are usually spheroidal and white with a few faint
markings of reddish brown.

"Common along the seashore. Frequently seen perching on the fish
pens of the natives, where it secures abundant food." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)



Genus HALIASTUR Selby, 1840.


Bill moderate, compressed, with a long overhanging tip; culmen well
curved, cutting edge slightly sinuate; wings long, extending beyond
tip of tail; inner webs of primaries abruptly cut; tail nearly square;
tarsus feathered in front for about half its length, the lower half
with large transverse plates, its sides and back with variously shaped
scales; claws strong and well curved.

shaded with ashy gray; head and neck pale rufous, with buffy white
centers and tips to the feathers, giving a streaked appearance, as
in a young Milvus; forehead, lores, and sides of face white, with
narrow black shaft-lines to the feathers; ear-coverts slightly washed
with brown; chin whitish; rest of under surface pale rufous-brown,
the shaft-stripes distinct, all the feathers with central streaks

under wing-coverts and axillars clear brown, tipped with rufous or
maroon, and centered with black shaft-streaks." (Sharpe.)

"Extremely common. Frequently abundant about shipping in the harbors,
where it feeds on refuse thrown overboard from the ships. Often seen
feeding over surface of fresh-water streams as well. Not infrequently
met with hawking over open fields at some distance inland." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

"Nearly adult female.--Crown and long occipital crest black; feathers
over eye, as well as the sides and back of the neck tawny rufous,
the latter spotted with black; sides of face grayish washed with
rufous; upper surface of body brown, with a gloss of purplish brown,
some of the feathers also shaded with greenish in certain lights;
quills brown, tipped with whitish, barred with purplish brown, the
secondaries very much paler brown, against which the bands of darker
brown contrast strongly, especially the subterminal one, which has
a distinct purplish gloss; under surface of quills grayish white,
with dark brown bands, pure white near the base; tail brown, tipped
with whity brown, and crossed by three bands of dark purplish brown,
the subterminal one being very broad, and glossed with greenish; under
surface of tail grayish white, like that of the wings, the subterminal
band distinctly marked, the basal ones very faintly, excepting on the
outermost feathers, which have a patch of dark brown on the outer web,
extending on to the inner one also; under surface of body whitish,
broadly streaked on sides of throat and chest, banded on breast,
and spotted on under tail-coverts with pale rufous, darker and more
inclining to rufous-brown on flanks, sides of body, and axillars; down
the center of the throat extending to the fore neck, a broad black
streak; under wing-coverts buffy white, spotted with pale rufous,
the lower ones barred with this color. Bill horn-black, browner on
lower mandible; feet yellow. Length, 444; culmen, 38; wing, 312;
tail, 206; tarsus, 38.

"Adult male (type).--Another specimen in the national collection
(British Museum) differs from the foregoing in not having so stout
a bill, in the sides of the face being more conspicuously gray, this
shade also extending over the throat and breast, the former of which
is narrowly streaked with grayish down the center; the crown of the
head is blackish, feathers of the forehead being edged with rufous;
the sides and hind part of the neck similarly marked, producing a
striped appearance; occipital crest black, with a narrow white tip to
one or two of the feathers; the bands on the breast very broad and
pale rufous. Length, 389; culmen, 34; wing, 292; tail, 190; tarsus,
38. This would apparently be the adult male, and the other perhaps
a female not quite adult." (Sharpe.)

thoroughly from the young of B. sumatrensis, and I feel sure that
the adult bird, when discovered, will be markedly distinct." (Sharpe.)

"Rare and shy. Iris, legs, and feet yellow; nails black; bill black,
slaty at base; bare flesh of head greenish yellow. One specimen had
been eating crabs when shot.

    Bohol (McGregor); Luzon (Meyer, Möllendorff, Everett, Steere Exp.,
    Whitehead, McGregor); Mindoro (Bourns & Worcester, Porter); Negros
    (Keay).


Adult (sexes similar).--Above, including wings and tail, black with a
dark green gloss; below white; sides, thighs, and under tail-coverts
black. Iris brown; bill and nails black; legs dark blue. Length of
a male from Mindoro, 160; wing, 110; tail, 68; culmen from cere,
11; tarsus, 20. A male from Bohol measures: Wing, 110; tail, 63;
culmen from cere, 13. A female from Luzon: Wing, 110; tail, 66;
culmen from cere, 12.

Young.--The immature male resembles the adult but the inner webs of
primaries are barred or mottled with white.

"Extremely local in its habits. Often found perching on a dead limb
at the top of some tree, and may be met with in exactly the same place
day after day. It feeds on insects and often leaves its perch on short
flights in pursuit of its prey, promptly returning, however. When shot
at but not killed it usually takes but a short flight, and returns
at once to its favorite perch. Small flocks frequently found together.

"Iris brown; legs and feet black; bill black. Nine specimens average,
179 in length; wing, 108; tail, 62; culmen, 13; tarsus, 22; middle
toe with claw, 21." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Microhierax meridionalis Grant, Ibis (1897), 220; Sharpe, Hand-List
    (1899), 1, 273; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 44.

    Cebu (Everett, Bourns & Worcester); Mindanao (Everett, Koch &
    Schadenberg, Steere Exp., Celestino, Goodfellow); Samar (Whitehead,
    Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult male.--Similar to the male of M. erythrogenys, but considerably
larger; the under wing-coverts and inner webs of the primaries
uniform black; and belly, vent, and under tail-coverts washed with
pale fulvous. Length, 165; wing, 113; tail, 66; culmen (from cere
to tip), 13; tarsus, 22. The type of the male is from Zamboanga,
southern Mindanao.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, but larger. Length, 183; wing,
117; tail, 70; culmen (from cere to tip), 13; tarsus, 22. The type
of the female is from the Island of Samar." (Grant.)

Grant's falconet is a species of doubtful validity, but the name may be
retained until more specimens have been examined. In M. erythrogenys
the white bars on the primaries are due to immaturity and are not
characteristic of the typical adult male.



Genus FALCO Linnæus, 1758.


Bill stout, culmen strongly curved from front of cere to tip; a
well-marked tooth in edge of upper mandible; wings long and pointed,
second primary longest, the first and third but little shorter; first
primary with a deep notch near its tip; legs, feet, and claws strong,
middle toe long; tarsus covered on all sides with small hexagonal
scales. The falcons are powerful birds, strong and rapid in flight,
and easily recognized by the rapid motion of the wings.



Species.


a1. Much larger; wing more than 300 mm.

"Adult.--Above bluish gray, darker on the head and nape, pale on rump
and upper tail-coverts; feathers of the head and nape, the scapulars
and sometimes other parts of the upper plumage dark shafted, and all
feathers except those of the head and hind neck with dark cross-bands;
forehead whitish; a broad cheek-stripe from beneath eye black;
primaries blackish, the inner webs, except near the end, closely barred
with white; secondaries ashy gray with darker cross-bands; tail dark
gray or blackish, with numerous ashy gray cross-bars, closer together
and paler toward the base, extreme tip and borders near tip whitish;
lower parts white with a rufous tinge, a few brown or black spots on
lower breast and middle of abdomen, and narrow dark bars on flanks,
lower wing-coverts, thighs, and under tail-coverts.

"Young birds are very dark brown above, the feathers edged with rufous,
the buff bases of the feathers showing about nape; tail-feathers with
about six transversely oval rufous spots on each web, forming imperfect
cross-bars; primaries as in adults; cheek-stripe narrower; lower parts
white, buff, or rufescent, spotted except on the throat, with broad
brown elongate median stripes, becoming broad spots on the flanks.

"After the first molt peregrines are brownish gray above and gradually
acquire a pure slaty-gray back. The spots and bars on the lower parts
are much broader at first and grow smaller and narrower with age,
the drops on the breast become narrow lines and ultimately disappear
altogether, the bands fade off the under tail-coverts and in very old
birds only small scattered specks remain on the abdomen and triangular
markings on the thigh-coverts. The general tint of the lower surface
varies from almost white to light rufous.

"Bill bluish, black at tip; cere yellow; iris brown; legs and feet
yellow. Length of a female, about 483; tail, 190; wing, 368; tarsus,
53; middle toe without claw, 57; bill from gape, 33. Males are

lemon-yellow; nails black; bill black, its basal third very pale
yellow.

"Adult male.--Head and nape deep black, including the entire sides
of face, cheeks, and ear-coverts; interscapulary region blackish,
with a few obsolete transverse bars of bluish gray; rest of upper
surface bluish ashy, barred all over with blackish, some of the bars,
especially of the upper tail-coverts, assuming a triangular form;
upper wing-coverts somewhat washed with brown, the gray shade being
more perceptible on the greater series; quills black, the primaries
outwardly shaded with gray, outer secondaries narrowly tipped with
creamy white, the inner ones almost entirely bluish gray, with obscure
blackish marblings and cross-bars; tail blackish, with a narrow ashy
white bar at the tip, the upper surface shaded with gray, clearer
toward the base, bars on center rectrices eleven in number, not
including the broad subterminal black band; throat and upper breast
deep creamy buff, the latter with a few median black shaft-stripes;
rest of the under surface buffy white, closely but narrowly barred
across with black, sides of body and thighs shaded with a bluish
gray tinge; fore part of breast and under wing-coverts with a strong
fawn-colored shade. Bill greenish at base, horny black at tip, under
mandible deep orange; feet yellow; claws black; iris dark. Length,
376; culmen, 30; wing, 300; tail, 152; tarsus, 51.

colored; underneath deep ferruginous, paler on the chest, the cross
barring narrow and irregular, sometimes confined to a small subterminal
spot. Length, 419; culmen, 37; wing, 338; tail, 168; tarsus, 51.

"Young male.--Above brownish, the feathers edged with fulvous,
especially distinct on the wing-coverts and secondaries; hinder neck
marked with pale tawny; lower back and rump alternately barred with
ashy and dark brown, the subterminal bar being somewhat triangular
in shape; tail brown, similarly barred with ashy and tipped with
fulvous; quills dark brown, with paler edgings; under surface
buffy white, inclining to deep fawn on the breast and abdomen,
which are longitudinally streaked with blackish brown, the flanks,
under wing-coverts, and axillars barred with the same color. Cere,
bill, and feet paler than in the adults.

"Young female.--Brown, head and cheeks blackish; feathers of
upper surface spotted and tipped with rufous-fawn; underneath
deep buff, inclining to rufous on the abdomen, the streaks on

distinct." (Sharpe.)



200. FALCO ERNESTI Sharpe.

ERNEST'S FALCON.



    Falco ernesti Sharpe, Ibis (1894), 545; Hand-List (1899), 1, 273;
    Grant, Ibis (1895), 438; (1896), 530; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 44.
    Falco atriceps Clarke, Ibis (1895), 476.

    Luzon (Heriot, Whitehead); Negros (Keay, Whitehead); Sibuyan
    (McGregor [25]); Siquijor (Celestino). New Guinea; Greater Sunda
    and Fiji Islands.


Diagnosis.--Similar to Falco melanogenys but blacker; beneath
everywhere shaded with ashy gray; wing-lining and axillars black,
crossed with narrow white bars. Length, 394 mm.; wing, 295; tail,
140; tarsus, 48. [26]

"The adult male [collected by Hose at 1,400 meters on Mount Dulit,
Borneo] is a remarkably beautiful specimen, and is evidently of the
same race of peregrine as Mr. Pretyman's bird from the Lawas River,
but is not quite so red on the chest. The closeness of the barring of
the under wing-coverts and axillars is remarkable and gives the species
a much blacker look than F. melanogenys while no specimen of the last
name falcon in the [British] Museum has the under tail-coverts and
thighs bluish gray like the sides of the body. Whether Falco ernesti
(as I have named the bird, after Mr. Ernest Hose) is confined to
Borneo I can not yet tell, but I think that it is very likely to be
found to be the resident form of all the Indo-Malayan Islands, as a
specimen procured by Mr. Maitland-Heriot in Manila seems certainly
referable to it." (Sharpe.)

Grant says: "In adults of F. ernesti, though the breast is occasionally
washed with fulvous, the sides, flanks, and belly are dark slate-gray
or bluish gray, and the whole of the under surface below the crop is
thickly covered with rather wide, close-set black bars, giving these
parts a very dark appearance."

"A very rapid flyer and usually seen on the wing. Much detested
by Spaniards and natives on account of its depredations on their
dovecotes and poultry yards." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus CERCHNEIS Boie, 1826.


Smaller than Falco but tail slightly graduated or wedge-shaped and
actually longer than in the peregrines; wing pointed, first primary

    in winter, Africa and the Indian Peninsula.


"Adult male.--Upper parts brick-red, with a few arrow-head markings
of black, larger on the inner secondaries; primary-coverts and
quills dark brown, the former narrowly margined with rufous, the
primaries notched with white for about two-thirds of their length,
the inner primaries and outer secondaries narrowly edged and tipped
with buffy white; head and neck clear blue-gray, with narrow black
shaft-stripes; forehead and narrow eyebrow buffy white; cheeks silvery
gray, inclining to blackish below the eye and on the fore part of
cheeks, forming a tolerably distinct moustache; lower back, rump,
upper tail-coverts, and tail clear blue-gray, the latter tipped with
ashy white, before which is a broad subterminal band of black; throat
and under tail-coverts buff, unspotted; remainder of under surface
rufous-fawn; the chest-feathers mesially streaked with black, these
dark centers being larger and more oval in shape on flank-feathers;
thighs clear rufous unspotted; under wing-coverts white, spotted with
black. Bill bluish horn-color, black at tip, yellowish at base; cere,
orbits, and feet yellow; iris brown. Length, 317; culmen, 44; wing,

"Adult female.--Similar to the male underneath but not so deeply
colored. Upper surface entirely rufous, banded with black, with a
faint bluish shade on the rump; upper tail-coverts inclining to buff;
head rufous, streaked with black; tail rufous, banded with black,

tail, 165; tarsus, 41.

"Young male.--Resembling the old female but rather paler and more
distinctly striped on the breast. The tail first changes, becoming blue
like that of the old male; and thus birds are often seen in partial
plumage, having the blue tail of the adult male, but retaining the
rufous head of the old female dress." (Sharpe.)



Suborder PANDIONES.


This suborder with a single family of two genera is distinguished
from the suborder Accipitres by having the outer toe reversible;
in addition to this the claws are very greatly curved and the under
side of each claw is rounded instead of being grooved or concave as
in the hawks and eagles.



Family PANDIONIDÆ.


Characters same as those given for the Suborder.

    Hand-List (1906), 45.

    Luzon (Worcester, Whitehead); Mindoro (Everett, McGregor,
    Whitehead); Palawan (Whitehead). Eastern hemisphere.


"Adult.--Above brown, most of the feathers with obsolete margins
of paler brown, more distinct on the wing-coverts; primaries black,
secondaries brown like the back, the primaries pale, but uniform whity
brown below, the secondaries whitish on the inner web, with indistinct
bars of ashy brown; tail almost uniform brown, tipped with whity brown,
and shaded with ashy externally, the inner web obsoletely barred
with ashy brown, a little more distinct below, where the interspaces
are whitish; head brown, with white bases to the feathers; a broad
white streak from behind the eye running down the sides of the neck;
ear-coverts blackish brown; sides of neck uniform with the back;
sides of face and entire under parts white, the breast varied with
brown centers to the feathers of more or less extent, the chin and
fore part of cheeks also slightly streaked with dark brown; axillars
and a few of the flank-feathers also marked with rufous-brown like
the breast; under wing-coverts buffy white, with dark brown centers,
the outermost almost entirely brown, with whitish tips. Cere blue;
bill black; feet blue; iris yellow. Length, 610; culmen, 44; wing,
503; tail, 241; tarsus, 61.

"Young.--Glossy chocolate-brown, all the feathers terminally
margined with buffy white, these margins somewhat tinged with
rufous, and broadest on the secondary quills and upper tail-coverts;
crown of head black, with white or fulvous margins to the feathers,
giving a distinctly streaked appearance; nape white, not streaked;
from behind the eye a broad line of white runs down the side of
the neck, slightly streaked with black; below this another line of
black feathers, including the ear-coverts, is conterminous; sides
of face and entire under parts pure white, somewhat tinged here and
there with yellowish buff; under wing-coverts white, the outer ones
strongly washed with tawny-buff, and crossed with broad bars of dark
brown; primaries black, secondaries chocolate-brown like the back,
and tipped in the same manner, all of them whitish at base of inner
web, indistinctly barred with pale brown; tail-feathers alternately
barred with dark sepia-brown and ashy brown, tipped with whitish,
and having whitish shafts; the bars six in number, and more distinct
on the inner web, which is buffy white.

"Nestling.--Covered with down of a sooty-brown color, except along
the center of the back, along the carpal bend of the wing, on the
breast and flanks, where it is dusky white; all the feathers of the
back are dark brown, with a broad tip of ochraceous-buff; crown and
ear-coverts blackish; eyebrow and throat white.

"Observation.--Ospreys seem to get whiter on the head with age; but
the mottling on the breast is at present unintelligible to me. It
appears to be strongly marked in all old birds; but the brown centers
to the feathers, which give the bird its mottled appearance, are
never exactly similar, there being a continued alteration in the
pattern of the feather itself. At the same time two young birds,
distinguished by the fulvous margins to the upper surface, have not
a similar amount of brown on the breast; for in one it is almost
entirely absent, while the other has very few markings indeed. The
tail becomes more uniform brown with age, so that a strongly barred
tail is a sure sign of immaturity." (Sharpe.)

"Observation.--In some specimens, apparently fully adult, the whole
of breast, chest, and sides of the neck are strongly mottled with
brown, and the feathers centered with a blackish stripe; the under
wing-coverts are barred with brown; the scapulars, upper wing-coverts,
and quills scarcely if at all margined with white; in others the
whole of the head and neck, except the ear-coverts and sides of the
neck immediately behind them, is white, without any brown markings,
and the dull brown of the chest takes no definite form, but is for
the most part darkest on the center of the feathers." (North.)

on under mandible; feet yellowish brown. Length, 279; culmen, 33;
auricular tufts, 37; wing, 165; tail, 89; tarsus, 37." (Sharpe.)

The type, secured by Cuming in "Manila," is the only known specimen.



210. OTUS EVERETTI (Tweeddale).

EVERETT'S SCREECH OWL.


    Scops everetti Tweeddale, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1878), 492; Sharpe,
    Hand-List (1899), 1, 287.
    Otus everetti McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 46.

    Basilan (Everett); Mindanao (Everett); Palawan (Whitehead, Platen);
    Samar (Steere Exp.).


Description.--"May be described as being a large form of Scops
[=Otus] lempiji as it occurs in Java. Above it has the deep rich
brown coloring of the Javan species; the same broad dark brown mark
in the form of a parallelogram on the head and nape; the same pale
colored forehead, stripe above each eye and round the nape, and
the broad dark stripe leading from behind the eye, and including
most of the ear-tufts; there are no pale uniform tawny or fulvous
scapulars. Underneath, the markings differ from those of the Javan
bird by being more confused, and by the absence of regular dark
brown cross-markings on the abdominal plumes. The general coloring
of the under surface is of a ruddier brown. Male: 'Iris deep brown;
feet whitish.' (Everett.) Wing, 165; tail, 89; tarsus, 30; culmen,
16. Female: 'Iris warm brown; bill pale greenish leaden, nearly white;
feet whitish gray; claws dark gray.' (Everett.) Wing, 171; tail, 92;
tarsus, 30; culmen, 17." (Tweeddale.)

"A single male specimen, secured in Palawan, measured 203 in length;
wing, 137; tail, 73; culmen, 15; tarsus, 29; middle toe and claw,
26. Bill pale horn, darkest at base; feet dirty white; nails black
at tip, gray at base; food insects. This specimen started within a
meter of the head of the collector, and flew less than three meters
before alighting.

"If S. everetti is a smaller race of S. lempiji it is hard to
understand the above measurements. We were at first inclined to
identify our Palawan specimen with the latter species, but after
comparison with Dr. Steere's specimen of S. everetti from Samar,
find ourselves unable to do so." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



211. OTUS FULIGINOSUS (Sharpe).

PALAWAN SCREECH OWL.


    Scops fuliginosa Sharpe, Ibis (1888), 197; Hand-List (1899),
    1, 287.
    Scops everetti Whitehead, Ibis (1893), 44.
    Otus fuliginosus McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 46.

    Palawan (Whitehead).


Diagnosis.--Similar to Otus umbratilis but much smaller, and entirely
rich brown; vermiculated and spotted as in typical Otus but auricular
region uniform rufous-brown; and with frontal and cervical bands pale
and obsolete. [28]

Whitehead, who collected the type, refers this species to Scops
(=Otus) everetti and says: "I find that Mr. Sharpe has not much faith
in his Scops fuliginosa, which in all probability is only the young
of S. everetti." Sharpe retains the species in his "Hand-List" and
therefore it is given here.



212. OTUS SIBUTUENSIS (Sharpe).

SIBUTU SCREECH OWL.


    Scops sibutuensis Sharpe, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1893), 2, 9;
    Ibis (1894), 244; Hand-List (1899), 1, 287.
    Otus sibutuensis McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 46.

    Sibutu (Everett).


Diagnosis.--Similar to Otus mantananensis but upper side of wings
scarcely spotted with white and quills but faintly banded below. "Bill
blackish brown; feet brown; iris yellow." (Everett.) Length, 203;
wing, 152. [29]

Everett collected an adult male and female and a young bird in
Sibutu. Sharpe makes the following observations: "This race is
intermediate between S. menadensis [from Celebes] and S. mantananensis
[from Mantanani Island, Borneo] which I described last year; the white
wing markings, however, are altogether smaller and not so distinct,
the under surface of the quills being almost devoid of markings. From
S. menadensis the Sibutu bird differs in having all the markings of
the upper surface very fine and not all over as in that species. The
quills have also more bars in the Celebean bird than in the species
from Sibutu."



213. OTUS LONGICORNIS (Grant).

LONG-HORNED SCREECH OWL.


    Scops longicornis Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club. (1894), 3, 51;
    Ibis (1894), 504; (1895), 439; Sharpe, Hand-List (1899), 1, 287;
    McGregor, Bull. Philippine Mus. (1904), 3, 7.
    Otus longicornis McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 46.

    Bang-aó, Benguet.

    Luzon (Whitehead, McGregor).


Adult male.--Upper parts bright rufous, the feathers with streaks and
irregular bars of blackish brown, mostly near their tips; forehead,
line over each eye, and complete collar white, the feathers blackish at
their tips; collar narrow but distinct on hind neck, wider on breast;
loral plumes with white bars and black tips, the longest plumes
about 28 mm.; ear-tufts colored like the head, longest feathers 31
mm.; ear-coverts barred with white, blackish brown, and rufous; chin
whitish; throat and sides of throat white, each feather with a black
tip and subterminal rufous line; breast rich rufous boldly mottled
with black and less white; abdomen, flanks, and under tail-coverts
largely white, the feathers mottled with blackish and rusty brown;
thighs rufous; wings blackish, mottled and speckled with fulvous and
rusty brown, tail similar. Bill dingy dull green, tip and cutting edge
dark brown; cere dirty flesh at base but dull yellowish green over
nostrils; legs whitish flesh; nails gray; iris bright yellow. Length,
184; wing, 145; tail, 72; culmen from base, 17; tarsus, 33.

Adult female.--Similar to the male. Length, 190; wing, 153; tail,
71; culmen from base, tip broken, 18; tarsus, 30.

Downy young.--The natal down is pure light gray; this soon gives place
to a soft gray plumage barred with brown, darker on head and upper
parts. A nest with three downy young was found in Benguet, Luzon,
on May 26.

"A single male specimen of this remarkable little owl was obtained. It
most nearly resembles Scops pennatus, but may be instantly recognized
by having the basal half of the tarsi entirely devoid of feathers,
as well as by the length of the horn-like feathers on the head, which
measure 38 mm., whereas in S. pennatus the longest are only 23. The
markings on the feathers of the head are coarse and form black bands,
and the whole of the markings on the back and under parts are coarser
and less neat. Length, 203; wing, 142; tail, 74; tarsus, 29; of which
15 is naked and covered with small octagonal scales." (Grant.)

The subject of Grant's remarks, quoted above, was a long-horned
screech owl collected by Whitehead in "North Luzon." The same collector
secured specimens in Lepanto and I have seen a living example which
was reported as having come from Nueva Ecija.



214. OTUS MINDORENSIS (Whitehead).

MINDORO SCREECH OWL.


    Scops sp. inc. Grant, Ibis (1896), 462.
    Scops mindorensis Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 98.
    Otus mindorensis McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 56.

    Mindoro (Whitehead).


Adult female.--Similar to Otus longicornis but smaller; hair-like
feathers on each side of mandible shorter, the longest less than 25
mm.; forehead and space above eyes almost uniform pale buff; ear-tufts
shorter, the longest feather about 30 mm.; white nuchal band obsolete;
lower parts mostly buffy, and almost entirely devoid of white. Length,
183; wing, 135; tail, 63; tarsus, 29. Male unknown. (Whitehead.)

This species is known from the type only, a badly damaged skin obtained
by Whitehead.



215. OTUS WHITEHEADI (Grant).

WHITEHEAD'S SCREECH OWL.


    Scops whiteheadi Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club. (1895), 4, 40;
    Ibis (1895), 440; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 97; Sharpe, Hand-List
    (1899), 1, 287.
    Otus whiteheadi McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 46.

    Luzon (Whitehead).


Description.--"This remarkably fine new species is most nearly
related to Scops everetti of Tweeddale, from the Island of Mindanao,
but it is very much larger, and is, in fact, the largest Scops at
present known to inhabit the Old World. The feathering on the tarsi
extends over the basal joints of toes; the light cross-bars on the
inner webs of the quills are much less conspicuous; and the middle
of the lower breast and belly is uniform whitish buff, in marked
contrast to the sides. Both the gray and rufous phases of plumage
are represented. Adult male. Length, 241 to 254; wing, 185 to 188;
tail, 91 to 94; tarsus, 42. Adult female. Length, 279 to 289; wing,
195 to 203; tail, 99 to 102; tarsus, 42 to 48." (Grant.)

"Iris golden brown; bill brownish white, tipped with white; feet dull
white, nails white." (Whitehead.)

Known from Whitehead's specimens only, which were collected in Lepanto,
northern Luzon.



216. OTUS RUFESCENS (Horsfield).

RUFOUS SCREECH OWL.


    Strix rufescens Horsfield, Trans. Linn. Soc. (1821), 13, pt. 1,
    140.
    Scops rufescens Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1875), 2, 102;
    Proc. Zool. Soc. (1879), 314; Hand-List (1899), 1, 287.
    Otus rufescens McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 46.

    Sulu (Burbidge). Malay Peninsula, Greater Sunda Islands.


Adult.--"Everywhere bright tawny-rufous, browner on the head and upper
parts generally, these also varied with small triangular cross-bars of
fulvous, which become larger and more distinct on the wing-coverts;
the outer margin of the scapulars paler and more inclining to
tawny-fulvous; ear-coverts 25 mm. long, and colored like the head;
lores and forehead clear fulvous, with little black spots along the
shaft of the feathers; sides of face rufous; inclining to dark brown
around the eye; behind the ear-coverts a line of black feathers running
down the sides of the neck; under surface of body tawny-rufous, paler
on the lower parts, and varied with little tiny spots of black along
the shafts, less distinct toward the abdomen, and absent on thighs and
under tail-coverts, which are uniform tawny-buff; quills dark brown,
barred across with fulvous, paler on the outer margin of primaries,
but less distinct on the secondaries, which are almost uniform rufous
like the back, but with indistinct bars of dark brown on the inner
web; tail rufous, mottled with dark brown vermiculations, making it
look darker than the back, with remains of five or six, more or less
plainly indicated, fulvous bars; under wing-coverts buffy white,
more tawny on outer edge, and having a line of dark brown feathers
near the outer margin. Length, 239; culmen, 229; wing, 132; tail,
66; tarsus, 27." (Sharpe.)

This species is included in the Philippine list because of the single
specimen collected by Burbidge which, however, may really represent
an undescribed species. Sharpe says: "This bird seems to me to differ
slightly from Bornean and Malaccan examples in having a much darker
face, the ear-coverts shaded with black. I do not, however, propose
to found a new species on a single example, and must wait for more
specimens. The measurements of the Sooloo [=Sulu] bird are as follows:
Length, 178; culmen, 18; wing, 122; tail, 66; tarsus, 22."



217. OTUS CUYENSIS McGregor.

CUYO SCREECH OWL.


    Otus cuyensis McGregor, Bull. Philippine Mus. (1904), 4, 17;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 46.

    Bu-caó, Cuyo.

    Cuyo (McGregor).


Adult male, light phase, type.--Feathers of head and neck heavily
streaked with blackish brown, the edges more or less notched with
whitish and light rufous; ear-tufts also blackish, but edges rufous;

upper tail-coverts; each outer scapular with a large white spot on
outer web followed by a blackish spot on tip and bordered toward base
by a dark brown line; chin and upper throat whitish with narrow brown
shaft-stripes, the webs marked more or less with cinnamon; remainder
of under parts dark cinnamon, more or less cross-barred with white
and dark brown, each feather with a blackish brown shaft-stripe;
the coloration heaviest across upper breast because of the greater
width of the shaft-stripes and reduction of the white areas; middle of
abdomen almost pure white; flank-feathers with narrow shaft-lines and
wide white bars; thighs rufous-brown; wings mostly sandy cinnamon more
or less mottled with brown; outer webs of primaries regularly notched
with five or six spots of white or whitish cinnamon, bordered with
dark brown; similar notches on secondaries but less prominent owing
to darker color of spots; quills below brownish with slightly lighter,
irregular, and almost obsolete bars; alula with similar light notches
on outer webs, on the first feather the notches are white; coverts
generally uniform, but some feathers of median series with large
white patches on outer webs; tail similar to the back with about eight
irregular and nearly obsolete cross-bars; short plumulaceous feathers
below and behind the eye finely mottled with pale cinnamon, brown, and
whitish; behind ear, feathers of the incomplete ruff broadly tipped
with blackish brown forming a prominent dark band on side of head;
bristle-like feathers of lores with bases whitish, tips blackish
brown, the longest about 20 mm.; anterior bristles pale cinnamon;
tarsus feathered to base of toes. Bill, cere, and feet dirty brown;
nails horn-brown; iris yellow. Length, 235; wing, 170; tail, 82;

    Calayan (McGregor).


Adult male, light phase; type.--Lower parts dark cinnamon finely
mottled with brown and white, a few feathers on throat and breast
with dark brown shaft-stripes or spots; abdomen, flanks, and under
tail-coverts extensively white with very little cinnamon and the
brown mostly reduced to fine speckles; thighs and tarsi cinnamon with
cross-lines of dark brown; upper parts dark rufous finely mottled
with blackish brown, producing a rather uniform coloration; lores,
continuous with a line above eyes, white; tips of nasal and loral
bristles dusky brown or cinnamon, the longest about 20 mm.; modified
feathers of ear-coverts and below eye finely speckled with white and
dark brown; behind this the incomplete ruff forms a conspicuous rufous
band along side of head, but most of the feathers tipped with dusky
brown; feathers of ear-tufts dark rufous with irregular blackish spots
toward tips; wing-coverts and scapulars about same as back, some of
the latter with a large white area on outer web; exposed surface of
quills and tail similar and a little lighter than back; tail crossed
by several irregular lighter bars; quills dusky brown; outer webs
of outer primaries notched with pale cinnamon; inner webs of quills
crossed by pale cinnamon bars which become very wide on secondaries;
tarsi feathered nearly to toes. Bill, feet, and nails brown, the feet
with a slight green wash; iris bright yellow. Length, 216; wing, 169;
tail, 85; culmen, 21; tarsus, 31; middle toe with claw, 29.

Female.--In every way similar to the male. Length, 203; wing, 164;
tail, 81; culmen, 21; tarsus, 31; middle toe with claw, 28. In the
red phase, the white markings, except a few bars and freckles on
abdomen and flanks, are replaced by rufous.



219. OTUS ROMBLONIS McGregor.

ROMBLON SCREECH OWL.


    Otus romblonis McGregor, Publ. Gov. Labs. Manila (1905), 25, 12;
    Phil. Jour. Sci. (1906), 1, 768; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List

more rufescent; black band on side of head narrower and less marked
than in cuyensis. Length, 222; wing, 158; tail, 76; tarsus, 29;
middle toe with claw, 28.

This species is similar to Otus cuyensis from which it differs in
having shorter wings and tail.



220. OTUS BOHOLENSIS McGregor.

BOHOL SCREECH OWL.


    Otus boholensis McGregor, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A, 323.

    Bohol (McGregor).


Female, type.--Crown, nape, and interscapular area, conspicuously
blackish, the feathers sparingly vermiculated and notched with
sandy buff; basal portion of a few feathers sandy buff forming a
narrow and hidden nuchal band; forehead whitish, the whitish marking
continued as a wide band over each eye to tips of ear-tufts on inner
webs, outer webs blackish spotted with fulvous, these white bands
more or less broken by fine vermiculations of dark brown; loral
plumes whitish with blackish tips; ear-coverts grayish, shaded with
fulvous and narrowly barred with dark brown, the hinder ear-coverts
tipped with black forming a short band; side of neck whitish with
fine blackish cross-lines and wide blackish tips to the feathers;
behind ear-coverts an imperfect ruff of whitish feathers with wide
terminal or subterminal black bars; chin whitish; feathers of throat
somewhat modified in continuation of the ruff; breast, sides, and
abdomen rufescent cinnamon with fine vermiculations and irregularly

the outer webs with large clear and distinct spots of sandy buff,
six in number on short first primary, and corresponding faint bars
on inner webs; secondaries dark brown with sandy buff bars somewhat
obscured by darker vermiculations; the primary-coverts resemble the
secondaries, and first quill of alula is marked like the primaries;
secondary-coverts, scapulars, and back vermiculated with sandy buff,
light buff, and blackish brown and marked with large irregular blackish
brown spots; under wing-coverts nearly white, inner ones uniform,
the outer buff mottled with blackish; edge of wing white; tail dark
brown, mottled with sandy buff and with seven or eight poorly defined
bars of sandy buff. Wing, 155; tail, 82; tarsus, 30; culmen from base,
24; culmen from anterior margin of cere, 16; ear-tuft, 29.

This owl is clearly allied to Strix lempiji Horsfield, and doubtless it
is closely related to Scops everetti Tweeddale, with which it should
be compared. The type was taken in the interior of Bohol and is the
only specimen known.

Adult.--"Above vandyke-brown, washed on the head with grayish,
and with rufous on the back, sides of neck, throat, and wings;
wing-coverts unspotted, the outer ones dark purplish brown, the
inner ones like back, scapulars with concealed white spots; outer
web of primaries light cinnamon-rufous with two or three partially
obliterated yellowish bars; tail reddish brown crossed with five
dusky bars and terminally margined with buff; under parts white with
long oval light chestnut-brown spots; under side of wing banded on
the inner webs of the feathers with yellowish isabelline except on
the ends of the primaries. 'Iris golden yellow; bill dark lead-gray;
feet light yellow.' (Platen). Wing, 218 to 235; tail, 115 to 136;
tarsus, 25 to 29; culmen from cere, 13 to 17." (Meyer and Wiglesworth.)

"A male of the Japanese hawk owl was obtained on the Island of Fuga. It
differs from the typical N. japonica from Japan and the Loo Choo
Islands in having the predominating color of the under parts white
instead of reddish brown, all the feathers being white, with an oblong
reddish brown spot, about 15 mm. long, at the end of each. Examples
from Luzon and Mindanao, however, approach the Fuga Island bird,
having less reddish brown and more white on the under parts.

"N. japonica appears to be perfectly distinct from the Indian
N. scutulata, the markings on the sides and flanks in the latter
species taking the form of wide bars with a detached heart-shaped spot
or bar at the tip of each feather. The sides and flanks thus appear
spotted, not longitudinally streaked, as in N. japonica." (Grant.)

The Japanese hawk owl is a common species. In Calayan Island I killed a
number of specimens on the beach and in both Fuga and Camiguin I found
it common in the forest. The number of bars on the wings and tail is
by no means invariable and must not be depended upon in identifying
this species.

    Whitehead); Siquijor (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino);
    Ticao (McGregor).


"Adult.--Above brown, the head slightly darker and more
chocolate-brown, the scapulars with large oval marks on the outer webs,
some of the inner ones barred with ochraceous; wing-coverts dark brown,
slightly washed with ochraceous, all of them distinctly spotted with
white or ochraceous white, those on the median and greater series large
and oval in shape; quills brown, margined narrowly with ochraceous,
and barred across with paler brown, almost obsolete on the inner web,
but indicated on the outer one by a distinct white spot, very plain,
and producing a checkered appearance; upper tail-coverts rather more
ochraceous brown than the back; tail-feathers sepia-brown, crossed
with six narrow bands of pale ochraceous, the last one subterminal;
frontal plumes whitish at base, but this color not visible; sides of
the face brown like the head, the ear-coverts rather more dusky; under
surface of body ochraceous brown, the chin whitish, and the throat
marked with a few blackish streaks; the abdomen whiter, the centers
to the feathers being ochraceous-brown, producing a broadly streaked
appearance; under tail-coverts white; leg-feathers ochraceous-brown;
under wing-coverts ochraceous, the edge of the wing white, those
coverts nearest the margin being marked with dark brown; the lowest
series sepia-brown, barred with pale ocher on the inner web, thus
resembling the inner lining of the quills. Length, 216; wing, 176;
tail, 102; tarsus, 51.

"Young.--Above rufous-chocolate, the upper surface almost entirely
uniform, with the exception of a few buffy white bars on the outer
scapulars; wing-coverts uniform like the back, and only a little
darker, the greater series distinctly spotted on the outer web with
ochraceous or white; primary-coverts uniform dark brown; quills dark
brown, notched on the outer web with ochraceous or buffy white; tail
darker brown than the back, with a fulvous tip and crossed with six
narrow bars of fulvous-brown; forehead whitish, with long hair-like
black bristles over the lores; side of face uniform rufous-chocolate
like the head; under surface of body fawn-color, the feathers of the
chest margined narrowly with whitish, causing a slightly streaked
appearance, the abdominal plumes white, with broad fawn-colored
centers, causing this part to appear very broadly streaked; thighs
fawn-color; under tail-coverts white; under wing-coverts fawn-color
excepting the lower series, which are brown, spotted with fulvous
on the inner web, exactly resembling the inner lining of the
quills. Length, 203; wing, 164; tail, 86; tarsus, 30." (Sharpe.)

"Five specimens average, 206 in length; wing, 177; tail, 89; tarsus,
28; middle toe with claw, 35; culmen, 14. Iris yellow; legs and
feet light yellow; bill yellow at tip, greenish at base. Food
insects." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Mr. Whitehead's Negros collection contains three adult examples of a
little hawk owl, and I am in considerable doubt as to whether this form
should not be separated from typical examples of N. philippensis from
Luzon. I have before me at the present time nine examples from Luzon,
two from Guimaras, four from Negros, and one from Siquijor. All seven
birds from the last three mentioned islands differ very considerably
from Luzon specimens. The latter have the chest and breast mostly
tawny brown, shading into pale tawny toward the edges of the feathers,
and the belly and flanks whitish, with rather ill-defined brownish
red middles. In Negros birds, as well as those from the other central
islands already mentioned, the feathers of the breast and chest are
chocolate-brown edged with white, and the rest of the under parts
are white, with fairly wide and clearly defined shaft-stripes of a
dark brownish red color.

"The general impression conveyed is, that the Luzon birds have the
under parts tawny brown, suffused with white on the belly and flanks,
while in birds from the central islands, the chest and breast, as well
as the rest of the under parts, are white, clearly striped with reddish
brown. These birds remind one of small examples of Ninox japonica,
though of course the latter has the stripes on the underparts of a much
darker color. It is quite possible that it may be found necessary to
separate the birds from Negros, etc., under some distinctive name,
but before doing this I should like to have more material from the
adjacent islands." (Grant.)



225. NINOX EVERETTI Sharpe.

EVERETT'S HAWK OWL.

    (1897), 449; Hand-List (1899), 1, 290; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 47.

    Siasi (Everett).


Diagnosis.--Similar to Ninox reyi but pale spots of primaries few,
fulvescent, very slightly spotted with white; and abdomen, flanks,
and thighs ocherous-fulvous, not white spotted with brown. Length,
241; wing, 195. [31]

This is a little-known species of which more specimens should be
examined and compared with Rey's hawk owl.



226. NINOX SPILOCEPHALA Tweeddale.

TWEEDDALE'S HAWK OWL.


    Ninox spilocephala Tweeddale, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1878), 940;
    Sharpe, Hand-List (1899), 1, 290; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 47.

    Basilan (Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, McGregor);
    Mindanao (Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


Adult.--Very similar to Ninox philippensis from which it differs in
having the head and neck spotted with rufous or tawny brown and the
white spots on primary- and secondary-coverts larger; decomposed
feathers below eye unusually long and entirely covering the true
ear-coverts. A male from Basilan is 230 in length; wing, 177; tail,
83; culmen from base, 22; tarsus, 26. Female, length, 230; wing, 158;
tail, 82; culmen from base, 21; tarsus, 28.

"Very common in the islands where it occurs. Hides among thick
vines or bushes during the day. Feeds on beetles, grasshoppers, and
the like. Iris yellow; legs and feet dirty, light yellow; bill pale
greenish horn-color. Ten specimens average, 214 in length; wing, 162;
tail, 76; culmen, 15; tarsus, 28; middle toe with claw, 22." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)



227. NINOX SPILONOTA Bourns and Worcester.

SPOTTED HAWK OWL.


    Ninox spilonotus Bourns and Worcester, Minnesota
    Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers (1894), 1, 8.
    Ninox spilonota Sharpe, Hand-List (1899), 1, 290; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 47.

    Cebu (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Mindoro (Platen, Everett,
    Bourns & Worcester); Sibuyan (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor);
    Tablas (Bourns & Worcester).


"Sexes alike.--General color of upper surface fulvous-brown;
feathers of head, nape, interscapulars, and wing-coverts spotted
with light rufous-brown giving the parts in question a decidedly
speckled appearance; rump fulvous-brown, upper tail-coverts faintly
spotted with pale rufous-brown; tail nearly black with nine narrow
transverse bands of light rufous-brown; quills like tail but spotted,
instead of barred, with light rufous-brown; scapulars like back,
some of them with large nearly white spots on outer webs; a few of
greater series of wing-coverts also spotted with white on outer webs;
chin and throat whitish, almost pure white in one specimen, in others
light rufous-brown, the feathers always with black shaft-stripes;
auriculars fulvous-brown somewhat mixed with light rufous-brown;
sides of neck like head; breast, abdomen, flanks, thighs, under
wing-coverts, and axillars rufous-brown, the depth of the color
subject to great individual variation, many feathers of breast and
abdomen with fulvous-brown spots and all with blackish bases; under
surface of wing fulvous-brown. Inner webs of feathers, especially
of secondaries, spotted and barred with light rufous-brown; a spot
of white on bend of wing; tarsus feathered for rather more than half
its length. Iris yellow; legs and feet pale yellow; bill black at tip,
gray at base. Two females measure, 241 in length; culmen, 13; tarsus,
31; wing, 181; tail, 102.

"A single specimen of this species was secured in Cebu by Mr. Worcester
in 1888. Its curious mottled back and under surface were suggestive
of immaturity, and Dr. Steere thought it to be the young of some
undescribed species. We have altogether too much material now to make
such a theory tenable." (Bourns and Worcester.)

A rusty brown male was taken in Sibuyan. Iris yellow; bill and legs
pale dirty greenish; cere a little darker; nails gray, blackish
at tips. Length, 285; wing, 210; tail, 114; culmen from base, 23;
tarsus, 32.

A male from Cebu is in the light phase. Chin, throat, and forehead
mostly white; rictal bristles with white bases; scapulars spotted with
white; abdomen and flanks very largely white and with no fulvous nor
rusty brown wash.



228. NINOX REYI Oustalet.

REY'S HAWK OWL.


    Ninox reyi Oustalet, Bull. Assoc. Sc. France (1880), No. 39, 206;
    Sharpe, Ibis (1894), 245; Hand-List (1899), 1, 291; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 47.

    Bongao (Everett); Sulu (Montano & Rey, Marche).


Diagnosis.--Distinguished at once from the common species (Ninox
philippensis) by its greater length (290 mm.), by its much longer
wings passing even the tip of the tail, and finally by its reddish
brown plumage and transverse brown bars on head and on shoulders. [32]

"A female from Bongao. 'Iris light yellow; bill greenish plumbeous;
feet greenish yellow.' The specimen now sent appears to be not
quite adult, but it shows the distinctness of the species from Ninox
philippensis in the barred upper surface. The upper breast is barred
with white and dark brown, and the flanks are white, with longitudinal
pear-shaped mesial streaks of pale rufous-brown. The tail has likewise
ten dark bands, much narrower than in N. philippensis, which has six
broad bands of dark brown." (Sharpe.)



229. NINOX MINDORENSIS Grant.

MINDORO HAWK OWL.


    Ninox mindorensis Grant, Ibis (1896), 463; Sharpe, Hand-List
    (1899), 1, 291; McGregor, Bull. Philippine Mus. (1904), 4, 17;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 47.

    Mindoro (Whitehead, McGregor, Porter).


Adult.--In color and color pattern very similar to Ninox spilonota
but very much smaller; it also resembles N. spilocephala in size
and pattern of upper parts but differs from the latter in having the
breast and abdomen cross-barred instead of boldly striped. Both rufous
and light phases occur in this species.

Male.--Iris yellow; bill, cere, and legs greenish; nails dark
brown. Length, 225; wing, 167; tail, 88; culmen from base, 20;
tarsus, 30.

Female.--Length, 220; wing, 158; tail, 78; culmen from base, 20;
tarsus, 23.

"An adult female of this little Mindoro hawk owl was obtained in
the lowlands, and is nearly allied to N. spilocephala Tweeddale,
from Mindanao and Basilan, resembling that species in having the top
of the head and nape barred with buff. It may, however, be at once
recognized by having the whole of the under parts, including the
belly and flanks, tawny-buff, transversely barred with brown, while
in the female of N. spilocephala, though the breast is generally like
that of the present species, the belly and flanks are always white,
with longitudinal reddish brown shaft-stripes. Length, 203; wing,
152; tail, 76; tarsus, 28.

"I have of course carefully compared this species with Bourns and
Worcester's description of N. spilonotus, specimens of which were
obtained in Mindoro, but the much smaller size of this bird serves
to at once distinguish it." (Grant.)



230. NINOX PLATENI Blasius.

PLATEN'S HAWK OWL.


    Ninox plateni Blasius (in litt.), Hartlaub, Abh. Nat. Ver. Bremen
    (1899), 16, 271; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 47.

    Mindoro (Platen).


Adult female.--Above reddish brown, slightly shaded with olive;
top and sides of head, hind neck, sides of neck, and mantle lighter,
pale reddish, and narrowly banded; on lower back and rump the bands
inconspicuous so that these parts appear nearly uniform; chin light;
throat-feathers light fawn-color with dark shaft-stripes, ground color
of chest and belly bright red-brown, with narrow blackish stripes;
bend of wing white; scapulars and greater wing-coverts with some
larger opaque white spots on outer webs; primaries with inner webs
uniform black, outer webs with broad dark brown and smaller pale
reddish band spots; on the tertials appear very inconspicuous, broad,
darker bands, and on the whole length of the edges of the outer webs,
pale fawn spots; tail-feathers with darker brownish bands of equal
width; under tail-coverts light fawn; inner wing-coverts light reddish
brown with darker spots. Legs light yellowish; iris yellow. Length,
250; wing, 169; tail, 80.

Male.--Differs only in the following that the bands on the lower
belly and thighs are on a lighter background; and the reddish brown
ground-color of chest and epigastrium is somewhat lighter. Wing, 168;
tail, 80.

Another female.--The brownish red of abdomen very fiery with irregular
and less distinct bands. Wing, 168 mm.; tail, 78. [33]

I doubt very much if this species is really distinct from Ninox
mindorensis; the size is nearly the same and specimens of the two do
not seem to have been actually compared.



Subfamily STRIGINÆ.



Genus STRIX Linnæus, 1758. [34]


Large; without ear-tufts; secondaries nearly as long as primaries;
plumage compact; barred below, spotted above; legs and toes closely
feathered.



231. STRIX WHITEHEADI (Sharpe).

PALAWAN BARRED OWL.



    Syrnium whiteheadi Sharpe, Ibis (1888), 196, pl. 3; Hand-List
    (1899), 1, 294; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 47.

    Palawan (Whitehead, Platen, Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


"Adult male.--General color above chocolate-brown, spotted with white,
the spots arranged in pairs, the one on the inner web often fulvescent;
scapulars forming a light patch of tawny-buff, covered with narrow
bars of chocolate-brown; lesser wing-coverts dark chocolate-brown,
with scarcely any white spots; median and greater coverts more reddish
chocolate-brown, transversely barred with white, slightly tinged with
tawny-buff; alula and primary-coverts uniform blackish brown; quills
brown, crossed with lighter and more rufous-brown bars, whiter near
the edge, especially of the secondaries, which are slightly freckled
externally; the innermost secondaries spotted with white, like the
back; upper tail-coverts like the back, but barred with tawny-buff or
whitish; tail-feathers dark chocolate-brown, barred with tawny-buff or
creamy white, with which the tail is conspicuously tipped, the light
bars, seven in number, on the center feathers, broader and coalescing
on the remainder; crown of head like the back, thickly spotted with
white, the spots arranged in pairs; feathers of the hind neck with
concealed bases of tawny-buff; the mantle somewhat more uniform brown;
sides of face chestnut, deeper about the eyes and on the ear-coverts,
which are whiter posteriorly; ruff dark chocolate-brown, barred across
with rufous; chin rufous, followed by a broad white patch, narrowly
barred with black; remainder of under surface of body tawny-rufous,
narrowly barred across with blackish brown including the thighs
and under tail-coverts; fore neck with broad bands of white and
chocolate-brown; under wing-coverts and axillars like the breast;
quills below dusky brown, barred with yellowish buff, these bars
broader toward the base of the inner web. Length, 444; wing, 330;
tail, 190; culmen, 34; tarsus, 58.

"Of this fine owl Mr. Whitehead obtained several specimens. Its nearest
ally is Syrnium sinense, but it is easily distinguished from that
species by its rufescent under surface, with the absence of white
bars." (Sharpe.)

Female.--In colors similar to the male, but size slightly
greater. "Iris brown; eyelids dark carmine; bill and nails
black." (Celestino.) Length, 460; wing, 340; tail, 200; culmen from
base, 39; tarsus, 50.

"We heard a large owl, in all probability of this species, hooting
at night in the Calamianes Islands; a single specimen was secured in
Palawan; it measured, 432 in length; wing, 202; tail, 186; culmen,
26; tarsus, 61; middle toe with claw, 48." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Family ALUCONIDÆ.


Middle toe pectinate; ruff around eyes and across throat fully
developed; primaries much longer than secondaries; proximal half of
tarsus fully feathered, distal half covered with much shorter, more
hair-like plumes; toes sparsely covered with hairs; plumage very soft
and fluffy.

Adult male (Benguet, Luzon, May 10, 1903).--Feathers of upper parts
dark brown, the bases and edges, more or less, yellowish buff,
this color forming a collar on hind neck; many of the feathers of
back and wing-coverts each with a small white spot near the tip;
a blackish spot in front of each eye; face white slightly tinged
with buff; stiff ruff-feathers white, the outer ones with black
shafts and blackish brown tips; sides of neck light tawny-buff with
large brown spots; under parts white with a few small black spots on

outermost pair. Bill white, legs dirty brown; nails brown. Length,
395; wing, 355; tail, 135; bill from anterior border of nostril, 19;
tarsus, 85; middle toe with claw, 55.

Female (Batan Island, June, 1907).--Similar to the male from Benguet
but darker; under parts heavily washed with ocherous-buff; face
washed with vinaceous-brown; the blackish spots of under parts more
numerous. Length, 406; wing, 368; tail, 130.

The difference in color between the male and female, as described
above, is not due to either age or sex and occurs in many, if not in
all, of the members of this genus.

Nestling (Laguna Province, Luzon, February 15, 1906).--Wings and tail,
as far as developed, like those of the adult; body and legs thickly
covered with yellowish buff down.

Adult (sexes alike).--White; under tail-coverts vermilion edged
with white; inner webs of remiges and rectrices sulphur-yellow
much deeper on the latter and in some specimens tinged with red;
sexes similar. Length, 300 to 350; three specimens measure, wing,
210 to 218; tail, 112 to 117; culmen from cere, 25 to 27; tarsus,
19 to 20. Iris bright red; naked skin around eyes, pale pink; bill
dirty white; legs and nails bluish.

The ear-coverts are usually tinged with vermilion and the bases of
crest-feathers are suffused with sulphur-yellow but both of these
characters are variable. Bourns and Worcester killed two specimens
in Panay in which "the plumage showed a peculiar faint pinkish tinge."

The "catala" is usually met with in small flocks either in forest or
fields; its presence is proclaimed by the conspicuous white plumage and
harsh note. In the island of Ticao we observed this species nesting in
holes in dead trees but we secured only young birds; these resembled
the adult. Bourns and Worcester took nestlings in Masbate in May, 1888.

"Iris of females usually blood-red, sometimes brown. We are inclined
to think red the normal color in fully adult females. Iris in males
very dark brown to black; bare skin around the eye creamy white;
bill drab, with white tip. Three females measure, 315 in length;
wing, 206; tail, 110; culmen, 25; tarsus, 18; middle toe and claw,
38." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Prioniturus verticalis Sharpe, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1893), 3,
    10; Ibis (1894), 248, pl. 6; Hand-List (1900), 2, 29; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 48.

    Bongao (Everett); Sibutu (Everett); Tawi Tawi (Everett, Bourns
    & Worcester).


Male.--Crown light blue with a small scarlet patch in the center;
forehead, nape, and sides of head grass-green; neck and sides of neck
yellowish green; remainder of upper parts, including exposed edges of
wing- and tail-feathers, dark grass-green; lower parts greenish yellow,
breast clearer yellow, abdomen, flanks, and crissum more greenish. A
male from Tawi Tawi measures: Wing, 180; tail with rackets, 150;
culmen from front margin of cere, 21.

Female.--"Differs from the male in being emerald-green all over, and
wanting the verditer-blue on the head as well as the scarlet spot on
the latter." (Sharpe.)

"Discovered by us in October, 1891; it is the finest of the Philippines
representatives of the genus. Found in deep forest, but especially
abundant in the high mangrove trees south of Tataan. The amount of
red on its head is exaggerated in the plate in The Ibis, and it is
too light in color.

"Eight males from Tawi Tawi measure, 268 in length; wing, 171; tail,
exclusive of racket, 90; culmen, 22; tarsus, 15; middle toe with
claw, 29. Four females measure, length, 255; wing, 165; tail, 96;
culmen, 21; tarsus, 16; middle toe with claw, 28. Iris varies from
pale yellow to hazel; legs and feet gray; nails gray to black; bill
gray to white." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



236. PRIONITURUS MONTANUS Grant.

MOUNTAIN RACKET-TAILED PARRAKEET.


    Prioniturus montanus Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1895), 4, 41;
    Ibis (1895), 466; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 397; Sharpe, Hand-List
    (1900), 2, 29; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 48.

    U-lis', Benguet.

    Luzon (Whitehead, Worcester, McGregor, Mearns.)


Male.--Forehead, lores, and face blue, bases of the feathers largely
green; a large red spot on vertex, surrounded by blue; hind head,
neck, and sides of neck grass-green; mantle, back, and rump duller and
more yellowish green; wings, upper tail-coverts, and middle pair of
rectrices grass-green; lower parts green, slightly yellowish. Iris
gray; bill, legs, and nails light horn-blue. Whitehead gives the
iris as "dark brown." Length, including rackets, 305 to 317; two
males measure, wing, 164 to 166; tail, without rackets, 84 to 85;
culmen from cere, 20 to 21; tarsus, 15 to 16.

Female.--Much like male but red and blue of head and face replaced by
dark green; a slight trace of blue on forehead and around eyes. Colors
of soft parts as in the male. "Differs from the female of P. verticalis
in having the head dull grass-green, the forehead, lores, sides of
the crown, and feathers round the eyes being washed with blue. The
under parts are like those of the male and never yellow-green as in
the Sibutu female." (Grant.) One female measures, wing, 158; tail
without rackets, 83; culmen from cere, 20; tarsus, 17.

Young.--Immature birds of each sex resemble the adult female.

The mountain racket-tailed parrakeet was discovered by Whitehead in the
mountains of Abra and Lepanto Provinces. At San Jose a live bird was
purchased. The natives said it "had been snared in their maize-fields
and that it was common enough when the cereal was ripe." We collected
a number of specimens in Benguet Province where it was not uncommon
though somewhat difficult to secure; the species is well known to
the Igorot by the name "u-lis." It is improbable that this beautiful
parrot occurs below the pine belt but with our meager knowledge of
the vertical distribution of birds in the Philippines it is better to
follow this statement with a large interrogation mark. This species
is very noisy and does not differ in habits from lowland members of
the genus.

Adult.--General color green, vertex verditer-blue changing with the
light; rest of head, neck, and face bright grass-green; rest of upper
parts and wings dark green; below uniform yellowish green; spatules
black, sometimes tinged with green or with blue; short rectrices
blue along shaft, bordered with green and tipped with black. Sexes
alike. Iris dark; cere very dark blue; bill light horn-blue; feet

specimens from Ticao measure, wing, 160 to 169; tail without rackets,
76 to 85; culmen from cere, 21 to 23; tarsus, 15 to 17.

"A common and widely spread species. P. discurus, as well as the
other five Philippine representatives of the genus, is usually met
with in the forest or in fruit trees in the open, where it has gone
to feed. At certain seasons it frequents the mangrove swamps. All the
Philippine species are birds of very rapid flight, and scream almost
constantly when on the wing. They usually fly in small flocks. In
the forest they make the most of their protective coloring, and one
may pass within ten feet of one without seeing it.

"Measurements are given exclusive of rackets. Four males from Basilan
measure, 232 in length; wing, 149; tail, 66; culmen, 21; tarsus, 14;
middle toe with claw, 28.

"Sibuyan birds are slightly larger, and have a light yellowish green
area on back, but we do not feel warranted in separating them. Three
females from Sibuyan measure, 257 in length; wing, 161; tail, 134;
culmen, 22; tarsus, 16; middle toe with claw, 29. Iris brown; legs
and feet leaden; nails blackish; bill grayish white." (Bourns and

Male.--Most nearly related to P. discurus but distinguished by the
crown patch which in mindorensis is blue with a slight violet tinge
and is sharply defined in front against the green forehead; the bill
is larger and the rackets are never so long as in adult specimens
of discurus. Length, including rackets, 317; wing, 165; tail without

    Worcester, Celestino, White).


Male.--All of head, neck, and under parts bright verditer-blue, a
little duller below where the feathers are yellowish at base, this
when specimen is held toward the light, away from the light the blue
parts become light bluish green; under tail-coverts bright greenish
yellow and tipped with green; wings, back, and rump grass-green;
tail-spatules black, touched with green; short rectrices green, deep
blue along the shaft, tip black. Bill bluish white; legs blackish. A
male from Palawan measures: Wing, 150; tail without rackets, 77;

Male.--General color bright yellow-green, very slightly darker
on back and rump; alula, primaries, and coverts dark green; short
rectrices green above, with wide dark tips; spatules black and dark
blue. Iris dark brown; bill and feet light blue; nails horn-blue. Sexes

with the shaft not naked and with no developed spatula, although
the webs become narrower before the end; the tips of the two middle
tail-feathers are blue; the lateral tail-feathers have, towards the
end, less blue than in the adult bird." (Salvadori.)

"We found this beautiful species common about the foot of Monte
Arayat, in central Luzon, though we failed to meet with it in Albay
or Catanduanes. In north Luzon it was abundant in the maize fields,
feeding on the flower at the top of the plant. Young were obtained
in the month of May in Isabella." Whitehead, Ibis, (1899), 397.

the grass-green collar of hind neck; [36] crown and occiput bright
blue; rest of upper parts green, yellowish on the mantle and more
or less mixed with light blue on the back; below yellowish green,
becoming clear green on abdomen and under tail-coverts; primaries
blackish on inner web, dark green on outer web, tips of shorter ones
blue; secondaries mostly blue with light green edges; tertials green
with blue tips; alula and primary-coverts dark blue, black along the
shafts and more or less washed with green; distal greater and median
coverts bright blue with yellow-green margins; proximal greater and
median coverts with the middle black, surrounded by a narrow line
of bright blue followed by a wide edge of old gold; lesser coverts
black, some of the proximal ones bordered with blue and old gold;
tail grass-green above, dark golden yellow below.

Iris very pale straw, a narrow inner ring of darker yellow; upper
mandible bright scarlet, except tip which like the lower mandible is
dull yellow, cere black; legs dull green; nails dark horn. Length,
300 to 330 mm. Specimens from different parts of the Archipelago
vary greatly in measurements and colors. The sexes do not differ
except that the female is a little the smaller. Four males from Ticao
average: Wing, 195; tail, 132; culmen from cere, 33; tarsus, 18. Two
females from Ticao average: Wing, 187; tail, 126; culmen from cere,
28; tarsus, 18.

Young.--Differs from the adult in having little or no blue on the head
and face which are green; back largely sky-blue; blue of wings and
coverts largely replaced by green; the coverts bordered with light
yellowish green.

"The Philippine green parrot is the common cage bird of the natives,
who have doubtless aided in its dispersal. Escaped cage birds were
shot by us on several occasions. Called 'picoi' by the natives. Occurs
in deep forest, but is also very common in the open, especially about
dead trees, where it nests in natural cavities or in deserted holes
of the great woodpeckers (Thriponax).

"Iris of male birds has an outer ring of white and an inner of brown;
iris of females light yellow; legs and feet drab, nails black; bill
scarlet, yellowish at tip. Fully adult specimens show very great
variability as to size, running from 300 to 395. Fourteen males
from Tawi Tawi measure 325 in length; wing, 191; tail, 126; culmen,
29; tarsus, 16; middle toe with claw, 29. Two females from Masbate
measure, length, 311; wing, 180; tail, 124; culmen, 30; tarsus, 17;
middle toe with claw, 35." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Grant finds some very considerable differences among specimens of
this species from various islands but evidently he considers them to
be of less than even subspecific value. Possibly this species will
eventually be split into several subspecies or races.

"This parrot may prove to have a much wider distribution in the
Philippines than is at present known, our discovery of the bird in
north Luzon being a mere chance. * * * Male, iris orange; bill rosy
red; feet dull olive-brown; female, iris orange; bill creamy white;
feet dull olive-brown." (Whitehead.)



245. TANYGNATHUS BURBIDGEI Sharpe.

BURBIDGE'S PARROT.


    Tanygnathus burbidgei Sharpe, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1879), 313;

    20, 432, pl. 11; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 49.

    Bongao (Everett); Sulu (Burbidge, Guillemard, Bourns & Worcester);
    Tawi Tawi (Everett, Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult.--Dark green; head and neck bright yellowish green;
lower back and uropygium deep turquoise-blue; upper wing-coverts
with very narrow yellowish green edges; tail above dark green;
underneath dull golden olive. Iris red; bill vermilion; tarsus dull
olive-brown." (Guillemard.) Length, 406; wing, 223; tail, 157; bill,
38; tarsus, 19.

"Young.--A little smaller than the adult, the head somewhat darker
and the bill whitish.

"This is a very distinct species, resembling T. everetti, but much
larger and with the head lighter than the body, and no blue edgings
to the feathers of the interscapular region." (Salvadori.)

"Common in Sulu but very shy, and seemed to be
shot-proof. Unfortunately, too, it was molting at the time of our stay,
and but two good specimens were secured. Readily distinguished from
T. lucionensis by its cry alone. Found in deep forest, and in fruit
trees in the open.

"Two males average, 375 in length; wing, 213; tail, 150; culmen,
33. Less common in Tawi Tawi, and observed only in the forest." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

    Hand-List (1906), 49.

    Leyte (Whitehead); Samar (Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead).


Male.--"Similar to the male of B. lunulatus, from which it differs
in having the face of a deeper blue with a purple tinge, and a blue
collar on the lower part of the hind neck brighter and like that
of B. mindanensis; the under parts are of a deeper and brighter
green than either in B. lunulatus or in B. mindanensis; bill black;
feet greenish. Length, 147; wing, 99; tail, 33; bill, 19; tarsus,
10." (Salvadori.)

confined to the throat, the cheeks being light green. Around the eye a
ring of green lighter than that of crown. The blue collar is replaced
by an indistinct collar of faint orange-yellow. Rump only slightly
lighter than back and green, not yellow as in male. Under surface
slightly lighter and more yellowish. Thighs green instead of yellow.

"A young male is like the female but has less blue on sides of
throat." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"A male measures 168 in length; wing, 98; tail, 33; culmen, 18;
tarsus, 12; middle toe with claw, 22. Two females measure: Length,
168; wing, 95; tail, 35; culmen, 19; tarsus, 12; middle toe with claw,
20. Iris dark brown; legs and feet light olive-green; nails black;
bill blackish at tip, gray at base; cere black. Food guavas. All of
the specimens obtained were shot from a flock found in a mangrove swamp
the day before our departure from Samar." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Mindanao (Cuming, Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    Goodfellow, Celestino); Panaon (Everett).


"Adult male.--Differs from that of B. lunulatus in having the cheeks
green, the blue round the eyes separated by the green cheeks from
the blue of the throat; the collar on the lower hind neck is of a
brighter and deeper blue; the green of the head has a yellowish
tinge, contrasting with the purer green color of the back. Iris
dark brown; bill black, the base of the maxilla light gray; feet
greenish." (Everett.) Length, about 152; wing, 96 to 99; tail, 33;
bill, 18; tarsus, 10.

wing, 96; tail, 41; culmen, 18; tarsus, 12; middle toe with claw,
19. Iris brown; legs and feet light olive-green. Called by the natives
'guayabero' from its habit of eating guavas. On the few occasions
when we met with this species it occurred in flocks. It is a common
cage bird in Mindanao. We searched in vain for it in Basilan, but
are by no means satisfied that it does not exist there." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

CEBU COLASISI.


    Loriculus chrysonotus Sclater, Ibis (1872), 324, pl. 11; Salvadori,
    Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1891), 20, 522; Sharpe, Hand-List (1900),
    2, 36; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 50.

    Co-lan'-si, Toledo, Cebu.

    Cebu (Meyer, Steere, Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    McGregor).


"Adult male (type).--Green, underneath yellowish green; forehead, rump,
and upper tail-coverts red; vertex, occiput, nape, and upper back
golden yellow; an obsolete spot in the middle of the nape, also the
upper back, tinged with orange; cheeks, sides of the head and of the
neck grass-green; a large patch on the throat orange-red, the yellow
color of the base of the feathers showing through; sides of the lower
back tinged with blue; quills and tail above dark green; inner web
of the quills and tail beneath blue; tail-feathers tipped with light
green. 'Iris brown; bill orange-red; feet orange.' (Everett.) Length,
157; wing, 99; tail, 51; bill, 15; tarsus, 11.

"Adult female.--Differs from the male in having the anterior part of
the cheeks and throat tinged with blue; no red patch on the throat; the
golden yellow tinge on the head and nape not so bright; the upper back,
or interscapular region, green, slightly washed with golden orange,
and the blue tinge on the sides of the lower back paler." (Salvadori.)

"This was the only Loriculus which we failed to find abundantly in
coconut-trees where the trees themselves were accessible. In 1888
several days of hard work in the great coconut-groves near Carmen,
Cebu, brought us but a single specimen. In 1893, however, we found
it quite abundant in the woods near Toledo. It is possible that its
disappearance from the coconut-groves of the east coast is due to the
lack of suitable breeding ground near by. The forest has been almost
entirely cleared from the island, and the little which remains will
soon be gone.

"Five males average, 154 in length; wing, 96; tail, 54; culmen, 14;
tarsus, 11; middle toe with claw, 19. Five females, length, 157; wing,
97; tail, 55; culmen, 13; tarsus, 11; middle toe with claw, 20. Iris
dark brown; legs and feet orange-red; nails black; bill usually
scarlet, may be pale red or even yellow." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Exp., Whitehead, Bourns & Worcester, Keay); Panay (Murray, Steere,
    Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester); Ticao (McGregor).


Adult male.--A wide band of golden yellow across vertex, touching the
scarlet forehead; a narrow band of golden orange on nape; mantle and
back grass-green. A male from Ticao measures: Length, 145; wing, 93;
tail, 46; culmen from cere, 16.

Adult female.--Vertex green, tinged with yellow; a narrow band of
golden orange on nape; cheeks tinged with light blue; throat and
breast yellowish green. A female from Ticao measures: Length, 150;
wing, 93; tail, 42; culmen from cere, 14.

"Exceedingly abundant in the central Philippines, especially
in Masbate. Though a large series of specimens was obtained from
Tablas, Romblon, and Sibuyan, none of the males show so much yellow
on the crown as in typical L. regulus. Specimens of L. philippensis
from Marinduque collected by the Steere Expedition show a decided
wash of yellow on the crown, and it seems quite possible that
other intermediate forms between L. philippensis and L. regulus may
eventually be discovered in Banton and the other islands which connect
the Tablas-Romblon-Sibuyan group with Luzon.

"Ten males from Masbate measure, 149 in length; wing, 90; tail, 47;
culmen, 14; tarsus, 12; middle toe with claw, 19. Thirteen females
from the same locality, length, 147; wing, 91; tail, 47; culmen,
13; tarsus, 10; middle toe with claw, 18. Iris brown; legs and feet
orange to brown or yellow; nails nearly black; bill deep orange-red
to brownish red." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Male.--Similar to L. regulus but the yellow patch on crown much
smaller. Wing, 97; tail, 46; culmen from front margin of cere, 14.

Female.--Similar to the female of L. regulus.

This form which is merely a subspecies of Loriculus regulus is abundant
in Romblon, Tablas, and Sibuyan.

    Banton (Celestino); Catanduanes (Whitehead); Luzon (Meyer, Heriot,
    Möllendorff, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead, McGregor);
    Marinduque (Steere Exp.).


Adult male.--Forehead red, bordered behind by a narrow line of yellow;
crown faintly tinged with yellow; a narrow golden orange band or spot
on nape. Length, 160; wing, 92; tail, 42; culmen from cere, 15.

Adult female.--Differs from the male in having the cheeks blue and
under parts yellowish green with no red breast-patch. Length, 152;
wing, 93; tail, 45; culmen from cere, 13.

"The habits of the Philippine representatives of this genus agree so
closely that a description of one species will suffice for all. The
eight Philippine species at present known are all peculiar to the
group. They are common in the deep forests of the wilder islands,
but are most readily observed and easily obtained in the coconut
groves near and in the native villages, where they feed on the
young blossoms and drink the 'tuba.' The latter article of diet is
the palm juice which the natives obtain by cutting off the blossom
stalks of the coconut trees and fitting a joint of bamboo over the
cut ends. The Loriculi are inordinately fond of this juice, and
many of our specimens were shot from the 'bombons' (bamboo tubes),
as they drank it. They are by all odds the commonest cage birds of
the Islands, and are frequently carried by the natives from place to
place. The various native names 'colacici,' 'cucci,' 'culanci' are all
attempts to imitate the note. They have the peculiar undulating flight
of woodpeckers, and give their shrill whistle at frequent intervals
when on the wing. Usually very shy in the woods, but exceedingly
bold in the coconut groves. Almost never seen in flocks." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

Adult male.--Red of forehead sharply defined against the bright
green of crown; no yellow band on nape or with a faintly indicated
spot. Length, 152; wing, 99; tail, 46; culmen from cere, 15.

Adult female.--Similar to the male but cheeks slightly blue, throat and
breast yellow. Length, 152; wing, 97; tail, 47; culmen from cere, 14.

"Abundant both in the forests of the interior and the coconut groves
along the coast. Six males measure, 152 in length; wing, 80; tail, 47;
culmen, 15; tarsus, 11; middle toe with claw, 18. A female measures,
159 in length; wing, 92; tail, 52; culmen, 15; tarsus, 11; middle
toe with claw, 20. Iris dark brown; legs and feet orange to dirty
yellow; nails nearly black; bill scarlet, black at tip." (Bourns and

    Hand-List (1906), 50.

    Siquijor (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


Adult male.--Forehead bright scarlet, ending sharply against the
green of crown; no yellow on the head and no yellow neck-band; rump
and upper tail-coverts dark poppy-red; red throat-patch small; all
rectrices, except central pair, tipped with light blue. Length, 165;
wing, 100; tail, 55; culmen from base, 16; tarsus, 11.

Female.--Similar to the male; red spot on forehead smaller and sides
of forehead, lores, cheeks, chin, and upper throat sky-blue; no red on
the breast. "Eyes brown; feet yellow; nails black." (Celestino.) Wing,
100; tail, 55; culmen from base, 14; tarsus, 12.

Young birds resemble the adult female but the red of forehead is much
reduced and the red breast-patch is wanting in very young males.

"The Siquijor colasisi is a well-marked species which seems to be
strictly confined to the little island of Siquijor. There is but little
forest on this island, and L. siquijorensis is found in the coconut
groves, fruit trees, and bamboo clumps. It is sharply distinct from
L. chrysonotus and L. regulus, and more resembles L. apicalis. The
female shows more blue about the head than does that of any other
Philippine species, having the cheeks, lores, a line over the eye,
and entire throat heavily washed with the color.

"Measurements of two males: Wing, 94; tail, 46; culmen, 14; tarsus,
11; middle toe with claw, 18. Six females: Length, 162; wing, 98;
tail, 52; culmen, 13; tarsus, 12; middle toe with claw, 20. Bill
scarlet to orange; legs and feet pale yellow to orange, nails nearly
black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Bazol (Everett); Dinagat (Everett); Mindanao (Cuming, Everett,
    Koch & Schadenberg, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino,
    Goodfellow, Waterstradt).


"Adult male.--Green; crown red, changing into orange on the nape;
back and scapulars washed more or less with golden; rump and upper
tail-coverts rich crimson; sides of the rump tinged with bluish;
cheeks and under parts yellowish green; a red patch on the throat,
with the base of the feathers yellow; quills black, dark green on
the outer web, blue on the inner web below; tail above green, the
lateral feathers blue toward the tip, and tipped with pale bluish
green; tail underneath blue. 'Iris brown, bill red-orange, cere and
feet orange.' (Everett.) Length, 147; wing, 91; tail, 43; bill, 15;
tarsus, 10.

"Female.--Differs from the male in having the lores, cheeks, chin,
and upper throat pale blue, and no red patch on the lower throat and
upper breast.

"Young.--Crown-feathers green at the base and tipped with orange
instead of red; the back pure green, not suffused with yellow,
the uropygium less intense crimson, mixed more or less with green;
cheeks, chin, and throat green, but in a second stage these parts
become more and more tinged with blue." (Salvadori.)

"Abundant in Zamboanga. The Panay record made by Count Salvadori for
this species on the strength of a specimen collected by Mr. Worcester
and marked from that island is certainly an error, probably due to
the misplacing of a label, as Mr. Worcester never shot L. apicalis
in Panay." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



256. LORICULUS DOHERTYI (Hartert).

DOHERTY'S COLASISI.


    Loriculus apicalis Salvadori, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1891), 20,
    528 (part); Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 36 (part); McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 50 (part).
    Loriculus philippensis dohertyi Hartert, Novit. Zool. (1906),
    13, 757.

    Basilan (Steere Exp., Everett, Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


"Adult.--Three males and three females from Basilan show at a glance a
much stronger and more reddish golden yellow wash on the back than in
the specimens from Mindanao. In the old males the whole back appears
to be golden orange, about the apical half of the feathers being golden
orange. In the females it is as strong, or nearly so, as in the males,
or in some specimens less developed, though always evident." (Hartert.)

Male.--Length, 152; wing, 94; tail, 47; culmen from cere, 15.

Female.--Wing, 94; tail, 51; culmen from cere, 12.

"The Basilan birds differ from Mindanao birds in having the nape
scarlet, not golden, and in having the feathers of the back broadly
tipped with orange. The back shows nearly as much color as in
L. chrysonotus. The species is very rare in Basilan however, and
while we think it probable that the Mindanao and Basilan birds may
eventually be separated, we do not feel warranted in establishing a
new species with so small an amount of material at our disposal.

"Two males average, 159 in length; wing, 89; tail, 44; culmen, 14;
tarsus, 97; middle toe with claw, 15. Four females, length, 144; wing,
83; tail, 45; culmen, 13; tarsus, 12; middle toe with claw, 17. Legs
and feet orange; nails black; bill scarlet." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

upper throat light blue; throat and breast yellowish green. Length,
152; wing, 94; tail, 48; culmen from cere, 13.

"L. worcesteri is scarce about Catbalogan, and as there are no coconut
groves near the town, we had great trouble in securing a good series
of specimens, being less fortunate in this respect than was the Steere
Expedition. Measurements from two males: Wing, 91; tail, 43; culmen,
15; tarsus, 10; middle toe with claw, 18. Iris dark brown; legs and
feet orange; bill red; nails black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

shaded dusky.' (Davison.)" (Salvadori.)

This species is included in the list of Philippine birds on the
evidence of a pair of cage birds obtained by Mearns, in Cagayan
Sulu. These were probably brought from Borneo.

Order CORACIIFORMES.

FROGMOUTHS, ROLLERS, KINGFISHERS, HORNBILLS, BEEBIRDS, GOATSUCKERS,
AND SWIFTS.


Claw of hind toe shorter than that of third toe; two toes united
for their basal joint; or, if toes are free, then the feet small and
weak and gape deeply cleft. Toes usually three in front, one behind;
in some, two in front and one behind; rarely, four in front and in
pairs. Bill large and with a horny crest, often bright red in color,
when not red the surface more or less sculptured (Bucerotes); or, bill
long, straight, tapering, and sharp, usually red or black (Halcyones);
or, bill slender and gently curved, tail long (Meropes); or, bill
stout, gape wide (Coraciæ and Podargi); or, bill minute and weak,
gape wide and deeply cleft (Caprimulgi and Micropodii). This order
is an extremely unsatisfactory one as its members have few external
characters of ordinal value. The suborders Caprimulgi and Micropodii
seem to be particularly out of place.

Genus BATRACHOSTOMUS Gould, 1838.


Bill extremely broad and short; culmen strongly curved; nostrils
covered by long hair-like plumes; eyes rather large; a bunch of
elongated feathers behind each eye; tarsus short, feet weak; outer

260. BATRACHOSTOMUS SEPTIMUS Tweeddale.

TWEEDDALE'S FROGMOUTH.


    Batrachostomus septimus Tweeddale, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1877),
    542; Challenger Report, Zool. (1881), 2, pt. 8, pl. 2; Hartert,
    Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892), 16, 638; Sharpe, Hand-List (1900),
    2, 43; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 50.

    Basilan (Celestino); Mindanao (Murray, Everett, Koch & Schadenberg,
    Bourns & Worcester, Goodfellow, Celestino).


Male.--General color rufous-brown; wings and upper parts
chestnut-rufous mixed with fine lines of lighter brown and blackish
brown, taking the form of obsolete bars on rectrices; a narrow white
band across mantle, bordered on each side with blackish brown; outer
webs of scapulars whitish, each feather with a black spot near its tip;
a wide creamy band across the fore breast, each feather tipped and
double barred with narrow lines of blackish brown, the double bars
concealed; another light band about 30 mm. posterior to this with
blackish tips but without the double bars; crissum buffy; primaries
and secondaries blackish, mixed with chestnut-rufous on outer webs;
primary-coverts nearly totally black, each of the secondary-coverts
with a large white spot at tip, preceded by a smaller black spot;
axillars buff. A male from Basilan measures: Wing, 160; tail, 121;
culmen from base, 29; width of bill at gape, 41; tarsus, 16.

Female.--Similar to the male but colors less rufescent; white collar
less sharply defined and the light webs of scapulars washed with
rufous. A female from Basilan measures: Wing, 150; tail, 114; culmen
from base, 27; width of bill at gape, 38; tarsus, 14.

This species is easily distinguished from B. javensis by its larger
size and comparatively much shorter tail, and by the sexes being
similar in their general coloration.



261. BATRACHOSTOMUS MICRORHYNCHUS Grant.

SMALL-BILLED FROGMOUTH.


    Batrachostomus microrhynchus Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1895),
    4, 41; Ibis (1895), 463; (1896), 121; Whitehead, Ibis (1899),
    384; Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 43; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 50.

    Luzon (Whitehead, McGregor).


"Adult male in very dark plumage.--Crown brownish black marked and
mottled with buff, nuchal band of the same color; mantle and back very
similar to the crown, but with more buff finely intermixed; scapulars
mostly clear buff, with mottled black barrings on the inner webs and
a black subterminal spot; wing-coverts black mottled with rufous,
most of the median and greater with a whitish spot at the extremity
of the outer web; sides of head, chin, and throat finely mottled and
barred with black and buff, darker on the hinder cheek; bands above
and below the chest whitish, edged with black; chest whitish buff,
finely mottled with black; belly rather paler and more coarsely marked.

"Adult female.--General color uniform chestnut, with scarcely a trace
of any black markings except on the secondary quills; in other respects
very similar in plumage to the female of B. septimus. The outer webs
of the scapulars rufous-buff, each with a small subterminal black
spot; greater and median wing-coverts with a terminal white spot on
the outer web, edged internally with black; nuchal and pectoral bands
white, edged with black." (Grant.)

Another male specimen was taken by Whitehead near Cape Engaño,
northern Luzon. "It is an interesting specimen in the chestnut phase of
plumage, the upper parts being like those of the female type described
[above], but the outer webs of the scapulars are pale buff, as in
the dark-colored male type, though the subterminal black spots are
small, as in the female. The feathers of the throat and of the chest
between the white bands are paler chestnut than in the female, and
have white middles irregularly edged and barred with black; belly,
flanks, and under tail-coverts brownish white, with a few faint
reddish brown mottlings.

"As will be seen, the length and width of the culmen are slightly
greater than in the types. There can not be the slightest doubt that
these three differently plumaged birds all belong to one species,
though Mr. Whitehead was inclined to believe that the dark and rufous
forms represented distinct species." (Grant.)

Grant's measurements of the three specimens described above, reduced
to millimeters, are as follows: Male and female from Lepanto: Wing,
127 to 132; tail, 99 to 102; tarsus, 17 to 18; length of culmen,
19; width at gape, 29. Male from Cape Engaño: Wing, 131; tail, 104;
tarsus, 18; length of culmen, 22; width of gape, 32.

In a female from Irisan, Benguet Province, the iris was pale yellowish;
bill light horn-brown, basal half of cutting edge dull pea-green;
inside of mouth brighter pea-green; legs and nails dirty white;
edge of eyelids brown. Wing, 132; tail, 104; culmen from base, 20;
width of bill at gape, 30; tarsus, 17.

    Cow-cow, Negros.

    Negros (Keay); Panay (Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult male.--Top of head rich dark-brown, slightly washed with
black; feathers of forehead buff, tipped with fulvous brown, forming
a distinct buff stripe reaching back to the eye; feathers of crown
lighter fulvous with spots of rufous-brown on the edges, each spot
being surrounded with black; some of the feathers tipped with rufous,
and having black subterminal bands; occiput and nape with less
black; elongated auriculars tawny-buff, with black spots and bars,
the tips being black; sides of face tawny-buff streaked with black,
lighter below; a distinct buffy white nuchal collar formed by white
subterminal bars on feathers of neck, the bases of which are dark buff
thickly vermiculated with black; their tips are black, and a black
band intervenes between the white subterminal band and the buffy bases
of the feathers; feathers of back dark brown, thickly vermiculated
with black; feathers of rump fulvous-brown, spotted with black and
reddish brown toward their tips, these colors assuming the form of
irregular bands on upper tail-coverts; a few of the shorter scapulars
almost black with irregular bars of dark rufous-brown; outer webs of
longer scapulars light buff, the two outermost feathers entirely of
this color; the next scapulars have inner webs thickly vermiculated
with black; inner and longest scapulars have both webs marked in this
manner, their inner webs being the darker; last of the longer scapulars
with an irregular terminal spot of black; lesser wing-coverts nearly
black, tipped with chocolate-brown; bases of primary-coverts fulvous
brown, their outer webs heavily spotted with rufous-brown, inner webs
less so, and a subterminal bar of black crossing entire outer web
and half of inner web, all the feathers tipped with prominent spots
of creamy white; secondary-coverts like primary-coverts but the black
bar and white spot confined to outer web; primaries fulvous-brown when
held toward light, changing to smoky brown when held away from light;
outer webs spotted with buffy white throughout their entire length,
the spots being much lighter on the second and third primaries; tips of
feathers mottled with rufous-brown; general color of secondaries same
as primaries, their outer webs and tips being spotted with rufous-brown
and these spots in turn being speckled with fulvous-brown; inner three
secondaries speckled with fulvous-brown, rufous-brown, and creamy
white, each feather with a terminal spot of fulvous; general color
of tail rufous-brown, distinctly barred with lighter rufous-brown,
each of these bars succeeded by a narrow irregular bar of black, the
entire feather thickly speckled with black and each feather having
a small black terminal spot; throat and fore breast like sides of
face; a buffy white pectoral band continuous with nuchal collar and
succeeded by a second creamy white band, the feathers between the two
bands being brown, thickly vermiculated with black and creamy white;
abdomen lighter; flanks and under tail-coverts ashy, slightly tinged
with pinkish, some of the feathers with dark black shaft-stripes,
others with small terminal spots of black; under surface of tail much
like coverts, the black markings of upper surface showing only faintly;
shafts of tail-feathers creamy white; under wing-coverts fulvous-brown,
tipped with white; axillars white. Eyes pale yellow; legs, feet, and
nails nearly white; upper mandible brown, lower dirty green. Culmen,
27; wing, 139; tail, 105; tarsus, 15.

"Food, beetles. Native name 'cow-cow.' The single specimen
obtained is a fully adult male; its rich and complicated markings
are very difficult to describe. We have named it in honor of
Mr. Menage." (Bourns and Worcester.)

Female.--"Head and hind neck a fine mixture of black and fulvous, the
feathers terminally barred with broader bands of these tints, producing
a spotted appearance; an indistinct buff band from the forehead over
the eye; elongated auriculars fulvous, banded and tipped with black;
nuchal collar banded with buff, fulvous, and black; mantle and lower
back reddish brown, closely vermiculated with black and darker than
the head; upper tail-coverts similar, but more coarsely vermiculated;
scapulars plain cinnamon on the outer webs, vermiculated with black
on the inner webs, each feather with a subapical spot of black;
wing-coverts like the back; some of the feathers with conspicuous
apical spots of white; primary-coverts chiefly black; primaries
cinnamon, barred with dusky on the outer webs, dusky on the inner
webs; secondaries cinnamon, irregularly barred and mottled with
black on the outer webs, dusky in the center and on the inner webs;
tertials cinnamon, vermiculated with black; tail cinnamon-rufous,
with transverse bands of a dark tint, which are narrowly margined with
black; chin, throat, and breast tawny, finely banded with black, the
concealed portions of the feathers of the upper breast being white,
subterminally and mesially banded with black; feathers of the lower
breast and abdomen chiefly whitish, margined with tawny slightly
vermiculated with dusky; thighs and under tail-coverts buff. Wing,
140; tail, 106; tarsus, 18; culmen, 25." (Clarke.)

There can be little doubt that the specimen described above is really
the female of B. menagei. Birds of this genus are so complex in colors
and so scarce in collections that it is very difficult to arrive at
a satisfactory understanding of their plumages and relationships.



263. BATRACHOSTOMUS JAVENSIS (Horsfield).

JAVAN FROGMOUTH.


    Podargus javensis Horsfield, Trans. Linn. Soc. (1821), 13,
    pt. 1, 141.
    Batrachostomus javensis Hartert, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892),
    16, 640; Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 43; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 51.

    Palawan (Whitehead, Everett, Steere Exp.). Borneo, Java, and
    Sumatra.


"Rufous phase.--Deep reddish brown, with numerous fine black
vermiculations; an indistinct white band across the neck, and large
white spots on the scapulars; under surface deep reddish brown below,
with a broad pure white band across the upper breast, the feathers
of this part being white with dark terminal cross-bars, one distinct
and one generally obsolete, the bases being dark. Many feathers of
the breast have very large central spots of white, margined with a
black line; abdomen mingled with blackish, brownish, and a good deal
of isabelline.

"Brown phase.--Above dark brown, with many pale bars and
vermiculations; a broad distinct band of whitish across the hind neck
and much white on the scapulars; a good deal of creamy white on the
lower surface.

"Blackish phase.--Several specimens from Borneo are black or blackish
in color, the vermiculations white or whitish.

"The reddish specimens are probably females, the brown and the black
ones being probably males in different phases or perhaps representing
different ages.

"The size of all is about the same, the total length being about 229
to 254; wing, 135; tail, 132; tarsus, 14; culmen, 20; width of gape,
33 to 35.

"The specimens described above are all from Borneo. Two females in
the British Museum from Sumatra, in reddish plumage, are lighter than
those from Borneo, being rather of a cinnamon-rufous color. The patches
on the lower throat are cream-colored, with a cinnamon-rufous border
and a blackish subterminal bar, but without any further blackish bars.

"These differences, however, seem to me not constant after comparing
the material in the Leyden Museum; nevertheless, I have not yet
heard of any blackish specimens from Sumatra, and it must therefore
be left open to question at present whether it is possible to
separate the Sumatran and Bornean specimens specifically or
subspecifically." (Hartert.)

size. Hartert gives the measurements of the male as follows: "Length,
about 216; wing, 114; tarsus, 13; width of gape, 25 to 30; culmen,
18 to 20."

Female.--A specimen recently collected in Palawan by White resembles
the brown phase of B. javensis as described under that species. The
specimen was taken near Iwahig on July 10, 1908, with its nest and
two small nestlings. The adult bird measures: Wing, 115; tail, 113;
culmen from base, 20; width of gape, 33; tarsus, 15.

Adult.--Forehead, crown, and sides of face black becoming dark
brown on occiput, neck, ear-coverts, and sides of neck; back, rump,
tail-coverts, scapulars, inner secondaries, and secondary-coverts
brown, washed with dull oily green; chin black with a small white
spot in the center; throat deep purplish blue with bright blue mesial
streaks; remainder of under parts greenish blue, becoming more intense
on crissum; primaries, outer secondaries, and rectrices glossy black,
marked more or less on both webs with deep purplish blue; a wide band
of light blue across middle of primaries; alula and primary-coverts
black, edged with deep purplish blue. Bill and legs bright red;
nails and tip of bill black. Length of a male, 280; wing, 180; tail,

"Young.--Differs from the adult in being duller in color and in having
a black bill, and in wanting the bright blue patch on the throat,
which is greenish, a little duller than the abdomen." (Sharpe.)

"Sixteen specimens measure as follows: Length, 352; wing, 181; tail,
109; culmen, 24; tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw, 26. Usually seen
perching on some dead limb from which it flies in pursuit of insects,
soon returning to its perch. Often seen flying about actively just
after dark, like a night hawk." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

This roller is easily identified by its gaudy plumage, bright red
bill, and peculiar jerky flight; there is no other Philippine species

    98; Hand-List (1900), 2, 48; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 51.

    Mindoro (Steere Exp.); Palawan (Whitehead, Steere Exp.). Borneo.


"Adult male.--Head and back of neck deep ochraceous, the latter
rather deeper in color; upper part of the back, scapulars, and lesser
wing-coverts rich blue; the median and greater coverts and the outer
aspect of the primaries rich ultramarine, inner secondaries entirely
of this color; tail ultramarine above, black beneath; under surface
of body deep rich ochraceous, a little lighter on throat and sides of
face. 'Bill and feet coral-red; iris chocolate.' (Everett.) Length,
330; culmen, 76; wing, 147; tail, 84; tarsus, 11." (Sharpe.)

"Included in this list chiefly on the authority of Dr. Sharpe,
who identifies a bird collected by Dr. Steere as P. leucocephala
(=javana). Mr. Whitehead speaks of 'two specimens' secured by himself,
and refers to the fact that the bird was discovered by Dr. Steere in
the Island. It is our opinion that the Mindoro bird is P. gouldi,
and we doubt the correctness of Dr. Steere's identification of the
bird collected by the Steere Expedition in Palawan. It might well
happen that an occasional specimen of P. javana should find its way
into Palawan, but there is little doubt that P. gouldi is the common
species there." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Palawan (Lempriere, Whitehead, Platen, Steere Exp., White).


"Adult (type of species).--Entire head and neck, as well as the whole
of the under surface of the body, rich ochraceous; upper part of
back, scapulars, wing-coverts, upper tail-coverts, and tail bluish
green; quills and tail-feathers rather more blue; entire back and
rump silvery cobalt. Length, 330; culmen, 81; wing, 152; tail, 89;
tarsus, 13." (Sharpe.)

Iris dark brown; bill and legs bright scarlet; nails dark brown;
eyelids scarlet. A male from Mindoro is 343 in length; wing, 143;
tail, 89; culmen, 85; tarsus, 15.

Individuals of this species are often found near the seashore where
they feed on small crabs; at other times they are fairly common
in mangrove swamps. A nest found in Mindoro on April 18, 1905, was
excavated in a deserted termites' nest which was fastened to a tree at
about 9 meters from the ground. The three incubated eggs were glossy
white and measured 37.8 by 27.6; 39.8 by 28.9 and 39.6 by 28.9.

"In Volume XVII of the Catalogue of Birds, P. gouldi is recorded
from Panay, the specimen having been collected by the Challenger
expedition. This specimen seems to have been identified with some
doubt as P. gigantea by Lord Walden, Proceedings of the Zoological
Society (1877), 536. It would seem altogether probable that this
identification was correct, as P. gigantea has since been repeatedly
found in the central Philippines." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Adult male (type of species).--Above rich purplish blue; the entire
back brilliant cobalt, changing to deeper blue on the lower rump
and upper tail-coverts; wing-coverts black, washed with purplish
blue, with a small spot of brighter blue near the end of each
feather; quills black, secondaries externally purplish blue like
the scapulars; tail black, washed with purplish blue; crown black,
barred with purplish blue rather brighter than the shade of the back;
hind neck beautiful purplish blue, with the black cross-bars more
or less obsolete; lores blackish, with a rufous supra-loral streak;
sides of face, ear-coverts, and cheeks purplish blue like the crown,
the feathers mottled with black bases; behind the ear-coverts a broad
band of white, tinged with ocherous-buff; throat white with a rufous
wash; rest of under surface of body from the lower throat downwards
chestnut-rufous, with a patch of purplish blue, lilac-tinged feathers
on each side of the upper breast; under wing-coverts chestnut-rufous,
a little paler than the breast. 'Bill blackish brown; feet coral-red;
iris brown.' (Everett.) Length, 135; culmen, 42; wing, 65; tail, 27;
tarsus, 9.

"Adult female.--Exactly resembles the male in color, and has even

the bill more, or less red, and generally the greater part of the
lower mandible is rufous. Length, 140; culmen, 42; wing, 66; tail,
27; tarsus, 6." (Sharpe.)

"Found chiefly along banks of fresh-water streams in forest. More
rare in mangrove swamps and never seen by us along the seashore. Iris
dark brown; legs and feet deep scarlet; bill black, reddish at base
of lower mandible. In a single case the bill was deep scarlet except
base and culmen black. Seven birds average as follows: Length, 155;

    Sibuyan (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Ticao (McGregor).


Male.--Lores orange-chestnut; sides of face, crown, and occiput
deep blue, the feathers tipped with silvery cobalt; back, rump, and
tail-coverts silvery cobalt; scapulars black, widely edged with dark
blue; wings black, secondaries edged with dark blue; secondary-coverts
dark blue, each feather with a spot of silvery cobalt; a large spot
of orange-chestnut on side of neck; throat orange-chestnut, much
paler on chin; middle of abdomen and a large spot on center of breast
orange-chestnut; rest of under parts deep ultramarine-blue and forming
two bands across the breast; axillars and wing-lining orange-chestnut;
tail dark blue. A male from Mindoro measures: Length, 145; wing, 60;
tail, 23; exposed culmen, 35.

Female.--Similar to the male, but all the lower parts deep
orange-chestnut except the pale throat and a single dark blue band
across the breast. A female from Mindoro measures: Length, 152; wing,
61; tail, 23; exposed culmen, 35.

"We found A. cyanopectus abundantly in Masbate. In Sibuyan it
was much more rare. It is to be found along the banks of small
fresh-water streams, which it is extremely loath to leave. In Sibuyan
one specimen was seen in a mangrove swamp. We never met with it away
from water. Legs, feet, and nails scarlet; upper mandible black,
lower red; food (in one case) fish.

"Eight males average, 138 in length; wing, 58; tail, 22; culmen,
39; tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw, 17. Seven females average, 142

272. ALCYONE ARGENTATA (Tweeddale).

SILVERY KINGFISHER.

    Alcyone argentata McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 52.

    Basilan (Bourns & Worcester); Dinagat (Everett); Mindanao (Everett,
    Koch & Schadenberg, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Goodfellow,
    Celestino).


Adult.--Sexes similar; upper parts, wings, and sides of head black;
bases of loral feathers white; sides of crown from above eyes to nape
with small white spots; back, rump, and upper tail-coverts white,
resulting from the wide tips to the feathers; white tip of each feather
preceded by a light blue bar which is more or less concealed; a large
white patch on each side of neck; chin, throat, and fore breast pure
white, forming a well-defined patch; thighs and middle of abdomen
white; remainder of under parts black, the breast and sides of abdomen
strongly washed with blue; greater secondary-coverts with white tips;
edge of wing and most of wing-lining white; axillars black. "Eyes
black, feet red; nails and bill black." (Celestino.) A male from
northern Mindanao is 152 in length; wing, 64; tail, 27; culmen from
base, 41; tarsus, 10. A female from the same region is 150 in length;
wing, 60; tail, 22; culmen from base, 39; tarsus, 10.

In some specimens the white patch behind ear-coverts is washed with
buff and some of the median secondary-coverts are tipped with pale
blue. These characters are probably due to immaturity.

"We obtained four specimens in Mindanao and one in Basilan; it is
extremely rare in the latter island, at least in the portion over
which we collected. Like A. cyanopectus and A. nigrirostris it is
invariably found along the banks of wooded streams."

"Iris very dark brown; legs and feet scarlet, much darker in some
specimens than in others; nails red to black. Three males from
Mindanao measure, 145 in length; wing, 59; tail, 21; culmen, 39;
tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw, 15. A female from Basilan measures,
143 in length; wing, 61; tail, 28; culmen, 39; tarsus, 9; middle toe
with claw, 16." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



273. ALCYONE FLUMENICOLA (Steere).

STEERE'S RIVER KINGFISHER.

    Ceyx fluminicola Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892), 17, 187;
    Hand-List (1900), 2, 53.
    Alcyone fluminicola McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 53.

    Leyte (Everett, Steere Exp., Whitehead); Samar (Steere Exp.,
    Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead).


"Adult male.--Similar to C. argentata, but differing in having the
breast and sides of body black, washed with ultramarine or purplish
blue. 'Bill black; legs and feet scarlet, the nails brown; iris
brown.' (Worcester.) Length, 127; culmen, 37; wing, 61; tail, 23;
tarsus, 10.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male in color. Length, 140; culmen,
37; wing, 58; tail, 22; tarsus, 9.

"The specimen from Leyte is more ultramarine on the breast than
those from Samar, which incline to purplish blue; but Steere unites
the birds from the two islands, and thus the Leyte specimen in the
Museum may be immature, especially as it has the throat and abdomen
tinged with buff. This last character Steere considers to be specific,
but I feel sure that it is a sign of immaturity." (Sharpe.)

"We had scant faith in Steere's C. flumenicola before our return
to the Philippines. But one specimen of C. argentata was collected
by the Steere Expedition, and that was so shot to pieces that the
differences between it and C. flumenicola were not in evidence to
any great extent. The examination of a good series of specimens from
Mindanao and Basilan has, however, convinced us that the Samar-Leyte
birds are quite distinct.

"The blue of the under parts affords the best means of distinguishing
the species, being much darker in the northern birds. The under
wing-coverts in the southern birds are white; in the northern birds
they are almost invariably light buff. All of our specimens from the
south have pure white throats, while the northern birds usually have
the white of the throat washed with buff. This last character is not
of a very satisfactory nature, however, as the northern birds show a
great deal of individual variation in this respect. This variation is
independent of the sex; nor does it seem to be, as Dr. Sharpe thinks,
a sign of immaturity, young birds in some cases having very little
of the color. C. flumenicola is always found along the wooded banks
of streams where it perches over the water.

"Iris very dark brown; legs and feet bright scarlet; nails usually
blackish; bill black. Food, in one case, small crabs. Eight males
measure, 136 in length; wing, 56; tail, 23; culmen, 36; tarsus,
8; middle toe with claw, 20. Five females measure, 139 in length;
wing, 57; tail, 23; culmen, 34; tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw,
16." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Cebu (Bourns & Worcester); Negros (Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead);
    Panay (Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult male.--Back and upper tail-coverts bright cobalt-blue, slightly
lighter than in C. cyanipectus; crown and nape blue-black, thickly
spotted with bright cobalt, the spots being much wider and slightly
lighter than in C. cyanipectus; spots much larger on hind neck,
causing it to appear nearly uniform cobalt; scapulars black, heavily
washed with dark verditer-blue; wing-coverts washed with verditer-blue,
each feather with a bright spot or stripe of cobalt-blue; wing black,
the outer webs of secondaries heavily washed with light verditer-blue;
tail black, the central pair of feathers washed with verditer-blue
on both webs, the others on outer webs only; loral spot reddish buff;
a spot of same color on sides of neck; chin and throat white, washed
with buff; fore neck, breast, and abdomen uniform buff; flanks, sides
of breast, and a complete band across the breast dark verditer-blue;
a half band of same color behind this; under tail-coverts buff,
the larger ones tipped with verditer-blue; under wing-coverts like
the breast, with a spot of verditer-blue at end; basal portion of
inner webs of primaries and secondaries washed with pale buff; bill
black. Average measurements from ten males: Culmen, 36; tarsus, 9;
wing, 56; tail, 22. Length of a single male measured in the flesh, 165.

"Female like male, but has only a half band of verditer-blue across
the breast, this being more imperfect than in C. cyanipectus. Average
measurements from three females: Culmen, 37; tarsus, 8; wing, 59;
tail, 24. Length of single female measured in the flesh, 143.

"A well-marked species easily distinguished from C. cyanipectus, its
nearest ally, by the heavy markings on crown and nape, by its black
bill and by the entirely different color of its under surface. Like
the former species, it is strictly confined to the banks of fresh-water
streams and it is usually found in the woods." (Bourns and Worcester.)



Genus CEYX Lacépède, 1799.


Bill intermediate in form between Alcedo and Halcyon, less compressed
than in the former, not grooved; culmen straight and slightly
flattened; only three toes, the inner or second toe wanting;
tail very short and rounded; plumage very bright, red often
predominating. (Blanford.)

"Above rufous; head, cheeks, and back thickly spotted with bright
lilac; wings black, secondaries edged with rufous; coverts black,
broadly tipped with rufous, these rufous tips carrying faint lilac
spots; breast rufous washed with bright lilac." (Steere.)

"With a very large series of specimens from Mindanao and Basilan
at our disposal we are unable to detect the slightest difference
between the birds from the two islands and we therefore unite them
under the name C. mindanensis, as the Mindanao birds were obtained
and described first. Frequents forest or low second growth away from
water." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Since Steere has attempted to separate the Mindanao and Basilan birds,
we give measurements from all our specimens:

"Eight males from Basilan measure, 134 in length; wing, 58; tail,
21; culmen, 36; tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw, 16.

"Eighteen females from the same place measure, 135 in length; wing,
58; tail, 22; culmen, 39; tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw, 14.

"Four males from Mindanao measure, length, 135; wing, 58; tail, 22;
culmen, 39; tarsus, 8; middle toe with claw, 15.

"Two females from same island measure, 143 in length; wing, 59; tail,

"We obtained a fine series of specimens in Samar which agree in every
detail with the description of C. melanura. The specimens secured by
us were found among the hills in deep forest and invariably away from

    Palawan (Lempriere, Platen, Steere Exp., Whitehead, Bourns &
    Worcester, Celestino, White); Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester,
    Everett). Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo.


Adult.--Above red, washed with lilac, heaviest on head and rump;
below deep yellow, strongest across the breast; chin and upper throat
white, washed with yellow; wing-coverts like the back; primaries
and secondaries black; first primary and the secondaries edged
with rufous; wing-lining yellow. "Iris dark brown; bill and feet
red." (Celestino.) Male, length, 140; wing, 58; tail, 23; culmen
from base, 40. Female, length, 140; wing, 58; tail, 24; culmen from
base, 40.

"We have fourteen specimens from Tawi Tawi, Palawan, and the Calamianes
Islands and they show some interesting plumage changes which were
for some time a puzzle to us.

"An adult pair in high plumage from the Calamianes have entire upper
surface of body red, washed with lilac, most heavily on head and
rump. Wing-coverts and scapulars like back. Secondaries rufous with
broad black shaft-stripes. Primaries black, the first rufous for
entire length of outer web and most of the others showing a small
amount of rufous at their tips. Under surface of primaries washed
with rufous on inner webs. Chin and throat white faintly tinged
with lemon-yellow. Remainder of under surface deep golden-yellow,
darkest on sides of breast and flanks. A yellowish white patch behind
ear. Under tail-coverts golden yellow, tipped with rufous. Tail uniform
bright rufous above and below. Under wing-coverts and axillars golden
yellow. Bend of wing rufous.

"This plumage we take to be typical for fully adult birds in fine
feather. Two females from Palawan agree with this description except
that in one the secondaries show rufous only on under surface of
inner webs, and that the primaries show no rufous except on basal
half of outer web of first. The under wing-coverts, axillars, and
bend of wing are light rufous instead of yellow.

"Sharpe, Ibis (1894), 246, reports an adult male of this species
from Bongao and a female from Tawi Tawi. We note certain differences
shown by our Tawi Tawi specimens, of which we have twelve. Of these
four agree with the Calamianes birds except that the scapulars show
more or less black at their bases and that the secondaries show more
of black. Among the remaining specimens, however, there are some
curious variations.

"First it is to be noted that in three fully adult birds beginning
to molt the under surface is pale dirty yellowish, the throat white.

"In two of the birds a few scattered yellow feathers are appearing
in the white of the throat. This then is the worn-out plumage of
old birds.

"A male with rich yellow under surface and white throat has some of
the scapulars entirely black, tipped with blue, the remainder being
tipped with lilac. Some of the wing-coverts are black, tipped with
blue. No rufous on primaries except on outer web of first.

"Another bird has chin and throat pure white, the breast mottled with
golden yellow and light cinnamon-rufous. Feathers of abdomen nearly
white, tips washed with rufous. Under wing-coverts and axillars
cinnamon-rufous. A little more black in the scapulars than the
preceding. Tail with broad black shaft-stripes on apical half of
under surface of feathers.

"Another specimen has chin and throat pure white. Sides of face,
breast, flanks, under wing-coverts, and axillars cinnamon-rufous,
deepest on the breast. Abdomen nearly white. A few golden-yellow
feathers appearing on breast, flanks, and abdomen. Scapulars, except
a few of the smallest, black quite broadly tipped with blue; tail
with tips of all its feathers black.

"Finally, a single specimen has under surface as in preceding except
that yellow feathers have not begun to appear. Scapulars and inner
third of inner secondaries black, the former tipped with blue, the
latter with rufous washed with lilac. Tail with apical two-thirds of
feathers black washed with rufous on edges of webs. The bill of this
last bird shows signs of immaturity, being blackish toward the tip
instead of clear scarlet.

"We were at first greatly puzzled by these birds, as the black
scapulars with their blue tips form a striking marking and with
a single exception the bills of our specimens showed no sign of
immaturity. After carefully examining the whole series, however, we
are convinced that the cinnamon-rufous under surface, tail-feathers
tipped with black, and black scapulars tipped with blue are themselves
signs of immaturity, the black gradually disappearing with age,
and yellow feathers appearing on the outer surface until the plumage
first described by us is reached. This finally becomes worn and soiled
giving the dirty yellowish under plumage already noted. Our Tawi Tawi
birds were shot late in October and early in November, Palawan birds
in December, and Calamianes birds in January and February." (Bourns
and Worcester.)

"Usually found along the banks of fresh-water streams in the forest,
not, however, strictly confined to banks of streams, but sometimes
met with in the woods away from water.

"Iris very dark brown; bill, legs, and feet scarlet. Food shrimps
and insects, in one case small lizard and crabs. Eighteen specimens
average as follows: Length, 140; wing, 58; tail, 24; culmen, 37;
tarsus, 8; middle toe with claw, 16." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Sulu (Platen, Bourns & Worcester); Tablas (Bourns & Worcester);
    Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester, Everett).


Adult (sexes similar).--Above, sides of head and neck, and wings
ultramarine to silvery cobalt-blue; having a more or less spotted
appearance on head; lores and under parts orange-rufous, but chin,
throat, and middle of abdomen white or with a pale yellow wash;
alula, primaries, and primary-coverts black; edge of wing and outer
web of first alula-quill and of first primary rufous; tail blue,
darker than back and coverts. In a male from Banton the wing is 68;
tail, 26; culmen from base, 39; tarsus, 10.

"Young.--Similar to the adult, but less brilliant and with a duller
red bill; the head, scapulars, and wing-coverts black, with blue
ends to the feathers; the blue of the back lighter than in the adult,
and inclining to cobalt on the lower back; loral spot as large as in
the adult." (Sharpe.)

This species exists under a number of plumages some of which have been
described as separate species. Bourns and Worcester have collected
a great number of specimens which show that these variations can not
be specific. In part they say:

"We find that we must either multiply the number of small blue woods
Ceyces from the Philippines indefinitely or reduce the above-mentioned
species [C. bournsi, malamaui, suluensis, and margarethæ] to one. It
would be an almost endless task to describe the different phases of
plumage shown and we will only say that we have a practically unbroken
series between a bird with a magnificent deep blue upper surface and
a bird with a fine silvery white upper surface which has not a blue
feather on it. In the latter specimens the white occupies exactly
the position of the blue in the specimens first mentioned.

"Our series shows that these extraordinary differences of color are
independent of sex, age, or locality, some young birds are very light,
others very dark. In one case where parent and offspring were killed
at one discharge of the gun they exhibited marked differences in color.

"The amount of blue or white is, however, dependent on age to some
extent, the young birds always showing much more black on the upper
surface than do adults. In the young the bill is at first black tipped
with pale horn and the legs and feet are pale flesh-color.

"Ceyx bournsi is a strictly woods form and its shy habits doubtless
explain its having been so generally missed by collectors." (Bourns
and Worcester.)

"Found in precisely the same locality as C. mindanensis and in company
with it in the Islands of Mindanao and Basilan. Food the same as that
of C. mindanensis.

"When one has learned its note and habits it may be secured without
great trouble. It always gives a shrill 'cheep' just before taking
wing, and repeats the same note at frequent intervals during flight. It
flies with great rapidity, but usually for a short distance, when
it alights on some branch, stump, or stone, where it sits perfectly
still. It is a bird of extremely local habits, and displays great
reluctance to leave the thicket to which it is accustomed. If pursued
it usually flies in a circle, soon returning to the place from which it
started, continuing to follow about the same course until the hunter
either shoots it or gives up the attempt. When its route has been
once learned, two men can easily bring it down, one driving it while
the other waits near one of its favorite resting places. In this way
we secured a considerable number of our specimens. We believe that
this species never 'fishes' in the streams.

"Iris dark brown; bill, legs, feet, and nails scarlet in adults,
growing paler in immature birds. Very young birds have the bill black,
with a whitish horn tip. Food, insects, larvæ and worms.

"Six males from Tawi Tawi measure as follows: Length, 140; wing,
64; tail, 25; culmen, 38; tarsus, 8; middle toe with claw, 16. Four
females from Tawi Tawi: Length, 141; wing, 64; tail, 24; culmen, 37;
tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw, 17.

"Five males from Tablas measure: Length, 146; wing, 65; tail, 25;
culmen, 36; tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw, 17. Four females from
Tablas: Length, 145; wing, 66; tail, 25; tarsus, 9; middle toe with
claw, 22; culmen, 36.

"We have given measurements of birds taken at the extremes of the
range of the species. It will be seen that the northern birds are
slightly longer. As stated in our preliminary notes, the color of
the dorsal surface of this bird varies from deep indigo-blue to
pure silvery white, and this variation is independent of age, sex,
or locality." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



280. CEYX GOODFELLOWI Grant.

GOODFELLOW'S KINGFISHER.


    Ceyx goodfellowi Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club. (1905), 16, 17;
    Ibis (1906), 6, 492.

    Mindanao (Goodfellow).


"Adult male.--Most nearly allied to C. malamaui Steere [=bournsi],
but the back, rump, and upper tail-coverts are of a brilliant
ultramarine-blue, tinged with cobalt on the middle of the lower back
and rump; the feathers of the crown and nape are also tipped with
much of the same brilliant color; the wing-coverts and scapulars like
those of C. malamaui, are of a deep purplish blue. 'Iris dark brown;
bill, feet, and nails bright vermilion.' (Goodfellow.) Length, 127;
wing, 63; tail, 22; culmen, 39; tarsus, 10." (Grant.)

This species, described from a single specimen, is doubtfully distinct
from Ceyx bournsi.



Genus HALCYON Swainson, 1821.


Bill large; culmen from base less than tail, rounded not flattened;
birds of medium size and various bright colors. The species here
included in Halcyon are by some authors assigned to at least three
genera but, other than their style of coloration, the genera Sauropatis
and Callialcyon seem to have no tangible characters. Halcyon hombroni,
lindsayi, and moseleyi stand apart from the other Philippine species
of the genus because of their short stout bill, longer tail, and
peculiar spotted plumage. The genus Actenoides might be used for
these three species.

Adult male.--Above, including wings and tail, dark rufous, heavily
washed with violet; on lower back, rump, and tail-coverts a narrow
stripe of silvery white, slightly washed with blue; below dark
cinnamon-buff, chin whitish; throat, breast, and under tail-coverts
washed with violet. Bill, legs, and nails bright coral-red; iris

"Probably ranges throughout the Philippines, but is as yet noted from
but few of the islands. It is sometimes found in deep woods away from
water, but more commonly along the banks of wooded streams and in
mangrove swamps. It is usually shy and hard to shoot, but in Sibuyan
two individuals of this species took up their abode in the bamboos
in our back yard, apparently attracted by the flesh of land shells
thrown out as we cleaned our specimens. In several islands where we
met with this species we obtained but a single specimen.

"Bill, legs, and feet scarlet; nails bright red or orange-red; iris

chin and upper throat pure white; remainder of under parts chestnut,
a little lighter than crown; basal part of primaries blue on outer web,
white on inner web; distal part black; alula and primary-coverts blue;
secondary-coverts black; edge of wing and axillars chestnut; tail blue
above and black below. When the specimen is held away from the light
the blues become green. Iris dark brown; bill and legs bright red;
nails black. A male from Bohol measures: Length, 280; wing, 124; tail,

Length, 286; wing, 124; tail, 83; culmen from base, 63; tarsus, 14.

"Steere states that neither this species nor H. coromandus nor even
H. chloris frequents streams. We can not agree with him. All three
of the species are frequently found along streams, and H. gularis is
usually found along fresh-water streams. It sometimes feeds in dry
open country, however. Several nests of this species were found by
us at various times. They were invariably placed in the mud nests
of white ants, and consisted of mere tunnels, without lining of any
sort. The eggs are pure white and highly polished. Two eggs before
us are nearly spherical, measuring 28.5 by 26.4 and 28.9 by 26.9,
respectively. Six others, while nearly as broad as long, are quite
abruptly pointed at the smaller end. They measure, 30.9 by 27.6;
31.4 by 28.7; 30.9 by 25.9; 32.5 by 28.9; 30.9 by 27.9.

"H. gularis has the legs and feet red, bill red, nails black, iris dark
brown. Six males measure, 282 in length; wing, 122; tail, 81; culmen,
64; tarsus, 14; middle toe with claw, 25." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

the Baco River, Mindoro, during our stay at Balete in April, 1905,
while other pairs excavated holes in masses of earth held among the
roots of overturned trees.

cheeks and throat white, extending down the center of the breast;
sides of the latter, flanks, abdomen, and under tail-coverts, under
wing-coverts, and axillars rich orange-buff; quills below black, with
a broad white band across the base. 'Bill deep red; mouth pale red;
eyelids pinkish plumbeous, covered with white feathers, except on

single Tawi Tawi specimen obtained was shot in the banana trees
about our house on the very day of our departure, and must have been
a straggler. Bill scarlet; iris very dark brown; legs and feet dark
red; nails black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Sulu (Bourns & Worcester); Tablas (Bourns & Worcester); Tawi Tawi
    (Everett, Bourns & Worcester).


Male.--Above, including wings and tail, deep blue; lores and a narrow
collar on hind neck chestnut; a band of light blue extending backward
from above eye and joining its fellow across nape; back, rump, and
central tail-coverts light silvery blue; sides of head and a small
patch on each side of breast dark blue; lower parts white; primaries
and alula black, remainder of wing-feathers edged with blue; tail blue
above, black below. Bill black, except under part of lower mandible
which is white near base; feet greenish drab; nails black. Length of
a male from Basilan, 255; wing, 103; tail, 75; culmen from base, 57;
tarsus, 14.

Female.--Above similar to the male but blacker because of the greater
restriction of blue on each feather; chestnut collar much wider;
below white, washed to a greater or less extent with fawn, heaviest
on breast, usually wanting on middle of abdomen. Length of a female
from Basilan, 255; wing, 102; tail, 75; culmen from base, 54; bill
from nostril, 46.

Young.--A specimen taken in Sibuyan indicates that the young male
resembles the adult female.

"A deep-woods form, usually seen perching in trees at a considerable
distance from the ground, though it goes to the ground to feed. On
being surprised when feeding it flies up into the trees at once. This
kingfisher seems to be fully possessed of the idea that it can sing,
and may often be seen at early morning or dusk, perched 15 meters
above the ground, and squawking away as if life depended on it.

"Familiarity with its habits and its note enabled us to procure it
in many islands where it was not previously known. It is, however,
a difficult bird to shoot at the best.

"Iris dark brown; legs and feet light greenish olive, sometimes
yellowish olive; nails black; bill black except base of lower mandible
which is usually white; tip of bill sometimes white; food, beetles,
grasshoppers, spiders, and grubs.

"Eight males average, 247 in length; wing, 98; tail, 74; culmen, 51;
tarsus, 13; middle toe with claw, 23. Thirteen females, length, 250;

on hind neck; this followed by a white collar; a spot of white behind
each nostril; wings, back, rump, and tail blue; scapulars greenish
blue like crown; rump and upper tail-coverts lighter and bluer;
tail, primaries, and secondaries deeper blue; under parts all white;

Young.--Immature birds have the feathers of breast, sides of neck
and breast, and sometimes the white collar, edged with black or dusky
brown forming crescentic marks on the breast.

"The commonest of Philippine kingfishers. Frequently observed perching
on native houses in villages and very common in coconut groves. Not
infrequently found fishing along small fresh-water streams in the
open, less common along wooded streams. Especially abundant in
mangrove swamps and along the seashore. The usual native name is
'tick-a-rool'." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    (1906), 55.

    Luzon (Lindsay, Eydoux & Souleyet, Möllendorff, Cuming, Everett,
    Heriot, Steere Exp., Bridges).


"Adult male.--Above green, a little brighter on the center of lower
back, rump, and upper tail-coverts; lateral upper tail-coverts and
sides of lower back and rump dingy green, the scapulars, mantle,
and wing-coverts each having a distinct spot of ocherous-buff;
quills brown, externally edged with fulvous, secondaries greener, and
terminally spotted with ocherous like the scapulars; tail-feathers dull
greenish brown, fringed with sandy buff at the ends, the penultimate
feather notched with buff on the inner web, the outermost one on both
webs, producing a banded appearance; head green, the forehead with a
few cinnamon feathers; lores black, surmounted by a streak of pale
cinnamon-buff reaching above the eye and continued into a line of
bright cobalt, which encircles the hinder crown and nape; feathers
round the eye black, continued into a band which encircles the hind
neck, and is followed by a band of cinnamon feathers, fringed with
black; sides of face and ear-coverts cinnamon; throat pale cinnamon,
separated from the band on the sides of the face by a broad band
of bright cobalt, which occupies the cheeks and lateral margin of
the throat; fore neck and breast mottled, the feathers being white,
margined with green, the green edges diminishing in size on the lower
breast, till they gradually disappear on the abdomen, which, with the
under tail-feathers, is pure white; sides of body like the breast;
thighs blackish, tipped with ocherous; under wing-coverts, axillars,
and quill-lining fawn-buff. 'Bill black, the culmen and under mandible
yellow; feet light green; iris brown.' (Everett.) Length, 241; culmen,
47; wing, 106; tail, 79; tarsus, 16.

"Adult female.--Resembles the male, but the band encircling the
crown is green instead of blue; the broad band on the cheeks is also
green, not blue; the throat is white; and the green edgings to the
breast-feathers are less pronounced. 'Bill black, the culmen and
mandible chrome-yellow; feet light green; claws horn-yellow; iris
brown.' (Everett.) Length, 249; culmen, 47; wing, 109; tail, 89;
tarsus, 16.

"Young male.--Like the adult male, but with smaller ocherous spots
on the upper surface; the band round the crown and the cheek-stripe
not so blue as in the adult, but not so green as in the female;
under surface as in adult, but with a fulvescent tinge throughout.

"Young female.--Duller than the adult female, and with smaller ocherous
spots; otherwise like the old female, and having a green band round
the crown." (Sharpe.)



288. HALCYON MOSELEYI (Steere).

MOSELEY'S KINGFISHER.


    Actenoides moseleyi Steere, List. Birds & Mams. Steere
    Exped. (1890), 11.
    Halcyon moseleyi Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892), 17, 288;
    Hand-List (1900), 2, 61; Grant, Ibis (1896), 557; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 55.

    Negros (Steere Exp., Whitehead).


"Immature female (type of species).--Similar to H. lindsayi, but
distinguished by the edgings of the breast-feathers, which are black
and not green. 'Bill black, culmen and lower mandible yellow; legs
and feet greenish.' (Moseley.) Length, 264; culmen, 46; wing, 109;
tail, 86; tarsus, 14." (Sharpe.)

"Moseley's kingfisher, a truly splendid species, is represented by
three fully adult males. The only example previously known is the
immature female originally described by Prof. Steere. From this female
type the male birds before me appear to differ in the following points:
The lower ear-coverts are chestnut instead of buff, the moustachial
stripes cobalt-blue, like the band round the crown of the head, and
there is a small triangular green patch in the middle of the black
interscapular region. From the adult male of H. lindsayi they are
easily distinguished by the generally black ground-color of the mantle
and scapulars, as well as by the black margins to the feathers of the
breast and flanks, only those in the middle of the breast being tinged
with greenish. Length, 254; wing, 107; tail, 80; tarsus, 18." (Grant.)

"Discovered by Mr. E. L. Moseley after whom it was named by
Dr. Steere. But one specimen was secured by him. We searched diligently
for this fine Halcyon on our return to Negros, but failed to find
it. It is undoubtedly extremely rare there. So far as we know at
present this species is confined to Negros, and no closely related
species is known from any island nearer than Luzon." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

    Ca-lao, Manila; reloj del monte, Spanish name.

    Luzon (Meyer, Möllendorff, Everett, Steere Exp., Whitehead,
    McGregor); Marinduque (Steere Exp.).


Adult.--Chin, upper throat, a band from throat to eye, and feathers
above eye, all black, followed on throat by a white space which shades
gradually into the dull chestnut-brown of lower throat and sides of
neck and head; breast and sides black; abdomen, thighs, and crissum
dull chestnut; back, rump, and wings brown, the rump lighter; primaries
and most of the secondaries black, some of the latter edged with pale
buff; tail-feathers pure white when fresh but soon becoming yellow or
dirty buff. Entire casque and bill bright red. "Naked skin round eye
yellow; iris red; feet brownish red; nails black." (Everett.) Length of
male, about 950; wing, 410; tail, 350; bill from nostril, 160; greatest
length of casque, 160; greatest width of casque, 52; tarsus, 60.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male. Length, 914; wing, 381; tail,

margined with buff; primaries and rest of secondaries brownish black,
margined on the outer web and tipped with buff; basal two-thirds
of tail-feathers reddish brown, margined in all except the middle
pair with black. Bill and casque dark black, except the base of
the lower mandible and the extreme tip of the bill, which are
blood-red." (Grant.)

The three Philippine species of Hydrocorax do not differ in colors
but they are easily distinguished by the color and shape of the bill
and its casque. These large hornbills frequent forest, where they feed
on fruits, usually in high trees. Their call is loud and penetrating
and may be heard at a great distance. Their flight is rather labored
and produces a great noise.

    Basilan (Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, McGregor);
    Mindanao (Murray, Everett, Koch & Schadenberg, Steere Exp.,
    Bourns & Worcester, Goodfellow, Celestino).


Adult.--Plumage as in H. hydrocorax but casque much narrower and bill
with distal two-thirds white. "Naked skin round eye sooty black,
yellow just before the eye, gular skin yellow; iris light yellow
(light green in living bird); feet coral-red; nails dark brownish
gray." (Everett.) Length of male, about 915; wing, 390; tail, 300;

breast white, blackish gray at base; rest of head, neck, rump,
belly, flanks, and tail-coverts white mixed with rufous; back,
upper wing-coverts, scapulars, and outer secondaries brown, the
three latter widely tipped, and the last named also widely margined
on both webs with white; rest of secondaries and primaries blackish
brown, with a white margin on the outer web, gradually increasing in
width on the outer secondaries; under wing-coverts brownish buff;
middle feathers of tail have basal two-thirds brown, and the rest

    Cao, Bohol.

    Bohol (McGregor); Leyte (Everett, Steere Exp., Whitehead); Panaon
    (Everett); Samar (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead).


Adult.--Colors of plumage as in the two preceding species, colors
of bill as in H. mindanensis, but the casque abruptly contracted in
front and its upper outline, in front, continuous with that of the
culmen. "Naked skin round eye darkest sepia, almost black; gular skin
dark indian-yellow; iris light yellow (light green in living bird);
feet coral-red; nails dark brownish gray." (Everett.) Length of male,
about 890; wing, 400; tail, 320; bill from nostril, 153; greatest
width of casque, 53; tarsus, 53.

"Adult female.--Does not differ in plumage from the male. Length,
787; wing, 350; tail, 279; tarsus, 53.

"Young.--Similar to that of H. mindanensis, except that the outer
tail-feathers have not the basal half chestnut, although the middle
feathers are the same.

"In older examples of both sexes, when the adult plumage has been
nearly attained the bill is jet-black, the yellow tip of the young
having disappeared, and the anterior part of the casque is distinctly
raised above the line of the culmen." (Grant.)

"Extremely abundant on the hills back of Catbalogan in Samar. Sometimes
comes down into the mangrove swamps near the town. In damp weather its
hoarse cry can readily be heard a mile. Usually frequents very lofty
trees, but may be readily called down by imitating its note. We secured
a fine series of specimens in this way. In a few cases we observed
H. semigaleatus feeding in low brush, and even on the ground. This
species has a highly developed oil-gland the secretion from which
is gamboge-yellow. When the feathers are well oiled the color of the
whole bird is changed. Feeds on fruit.

"Two males measure, 883 in length; wing, 385; tail, 305; tarsus, 57;
middle toe with claw, 74. Six females, length, 830; wing, 361; tail,
298; tarsus, 53; middle toe with claw, 71." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus ANTHRACOCEROS Reichenbach, 1849.


Casque small, compressed and rounded on top, its outline gently curved,
rounded and vertical behind, and continuous with culmen in front; very
fine striæ near base of bill; chin and upper throat partly feathered.



292. ANTHRACOCEROS MONTANI (Oustalet).

MONTANO'S HORNBILL.


    Buceros montani Oustalet, Bull. Hebd. Assoc. Scien. Fr. (1880),
    205.
    Anthracoceros montani Grant, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892), 17,
    370; Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 64; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 55.

    Sulu (Montano & Rey, Bourns & Worcester); Tawi Tawi (Bourns &
    Worcester).


Adult (sexes alike).--Tail white; remainder of plumage black; back
and wings slightly glossed with green. A female measures: Wing, 290;
tail, 260; bill from nostril, 101; tarsus, 52. This species has been
described as having the tail entirely white but in a female specimen
collected in Tawi Tawi, November 2, 1891, by Bourns and Worcester, two
rectrices on one side have the outer web black for about three-fourths
of the distance from base to tip and one feather on the other side of
the tail has the outer web black to a less extent; the inner webs,
also, are black for a short distance on two of these feathers. More
specimens are necessary to determine whether this is an individual
variation or a normal character, perhaps dependent upon age, which
has been previously overlooked.

"We were fortunate enough to secure a series of fourteen specimens of
this rare hornbill from Sulu and Tawi Tawi. The tail is pure white;
all other parts black, the feathers of the back and wings glossed
with dark green. The bill in adult birds is coal-black; all of our
adult males had the iris nearly white, while in the adult females it
was dark brown; legs and feet dull leaden, nails black. Young birds
have the tip of the bill white or pale horn.

"Common on the hills back of the town of Sulu, and very abundant
in Tawi Tawi where it occurs in great flocks, but very wild and
extremely difficult to approach. The cry of this bird is the most
peculiar bird-note we have ever heard. It begins with a series of notes
precisely like the 'song' of a common hen magnified about fifty-fold,
and ends with an indescribable combination of cackles and shrieks.

"Two males from Tawi Tawi measure, 717 in length; wing, 293; tail,
243; tarsus, 52; middle toe with claw, 59. Six females from same
locality measure: Length, 672; wing, 268; tail, 224; tarsus, 51;
middle toe with claw, 55. A male and two females from Sulu are
slightly smaller. Eyes vary from nearly white to nearly black, the
females usually having the darker eyes; bare skin of head black;
bill black. Food fruit." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus GYMNOLÆMUS Grant, 1892.

    Balabac (Everett); Calamianes (Bourns & Worcester); Palawan
    (Marche, Lempriere, Whitehead, Platen, Steere Exp., Celestino).


Adult male.--Rectrices pure white, their shafts pale yellow;
remainder of plumage black, glossed with dark green. A male from
Palawan measures: Length, about 710; wing, 290; tail, 240; bill from
nostril, 111; greatest length of crest, 106; tarsus, 52.

"Adult female.--Resembles the male, but the casque is less developed
and the size smaller. Length, 610; wing, 264; tail, 216; tarsus,
53." (Grant.)

"We saw this bird on several occasions in Palawan, but always in very
high trees, and it was so extremely wild that we did not succeed in
securing any specimens from that island. In the Calamianes Islands we
found it both common and tame. On several occasions we saw it feeding
in low fruit trees within a few feet of the ground.

"Iris brown; legs and feet leaden; nails black; bill white except
base of lower mandible; bare skin of head white. A female measures,
610 in length; wing, 263; tail, 204; tarsus, 46; middle toe with claw,

    Worcester); Negros (Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    Whitehead); Panay (Sonnerat, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester);
    Ticao (McGregor).


Male.--Head, neck, and breast pale buff; cheeks, ear-coverts, and a
band across neck black; back and wings black, glossed with dark green;
abdomen rufous; crissum, thighs, and upper tail-coverts chestnut;
tail light rufous, terminal third black, slightly glossed with
green. Iris red; bare skin of face white; legs dark brown; bill and
casque dull red, base of upper mandible with six or seven vertical
ridges, separated by pale yellow grooves; base of lower mandible
with several oblique grooves. Length, 650; wing, 290; tail, 275;
bill from nostril, 97; tarsus, 48.

Female.--Black; neck, wings, and back glossed with dark green; tail
as in the male but outer web of outermost feather entirely black
and inner web black at base; next feather with outer web black at
base. Iris red; bare skin of head bluish; legs and nails black; bill
black, casque dark red; grooves on upper mandible light yellow. Length,
600; wing, 260; tail, 245; bill from nostril, 78.

"Young female (without casque and only one ridge developed on the
base of the upper mandible).--Differs from the adult in having the
upper tail-coverts chestnut and the middle of the basal part of the
tail-feathers with more black. 'Naked skin round eye and on throat
white, faintly tinged with bluish; iris dull chestnut-brown; feet
dark lead-gray with faint greenish cast, nails black; bill brown,
with olive-green tinge.' (Everett.)" (Grant.)

"Very common in many parts of Panay, Guimaras, Negros, and Masbate,
but curiously enough absent in Cebu. A very noisy bird, called
'ta-ric-tic' by the natives from its note. Food fruit and occasional
beetles. Iris brownish red; legs and feet slate-color; nails black;
bare skin of head white.

"Four males from Masbate measure, 652 in length; wing, 260; tail, 228;
tarsus, 45; middle toe with claw, 52. Four females from same locality,
length, 607; wing, 252; tail, 216; tarsus, 44; middle toe with claw,
47." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

A set of three eggs of the Panay tarictic taken in Ticao, May 9, 1902,
measure: 48.5 by 32.5; 46.7 by 33.7; 45.7 by 33. In color they are
dull white with no markings except a few nest stains; their surface
is chalky with occasional minute lumps. The eggs were deposited in
a cavity in the trunk of a large tree. The entrance was plastered
up by the birds, leaving but a narrow slit through which the female
was fed by her mate. The female remains within the cavity during the
whole period of incubation. As she molts at this time she is probably
unable to fly even if liberated.



295. PENELOPIDES MANILLÆ (Boddaert).

LUZON TARICTIC.


    Buceros manillæ Boddaert, Tabl. Pl. Enl. (1783), 54.
    Penelopides manillæ Grant, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892), 17, 373;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 56.
    Penelopides manillæ Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 65.

    Ta-lic-tic, native name in vicinity of Manila.

    Luzon (Cuming, Meyer, Everett, Heriot, Marche, Steere Exp.,
    Whitehead, McGregor); Marinduque (Steere Exp.).


"Adult male.--Top of the head and neck yellowish white; cheeks,
ear-coverts, and feathered part of throat black; back, rump, upper
tail-coverts, and wings brown, more or less glossed with dull green,
most of the primaries, the secondaries, and their coverts narrowly
margined with buff on the outer web; breast, belly, thighs, and
under tail-coverts white, tinged with buff; basal half of tail dark
brown, succeeded by a wide white band (stained rufous) followed
by a terminal black band glossed with green; the outer web of the
outer tail-feathers is uniform black; naked skin round eye and
on chin and throat white. Iris crimson; feet and nails dull black;
casque transparent horn-brown; bill dark brown; the base of the upper
mandible with five transverse ridges, that of the lower with about
four oblique ridges separated by ocher-colored grooves. Length, 525;
wing, 233; tail, 188; tarsus, 43.

"Young male differs from the adult in having the upper tail-coverts
chestnut and the buff edges to the quills and coverts much wider.

"Adult female.--Head and neck very dark brown; back, rump, upper
tail-coverts, and wings dark brown, glossed with dull green;
under parts brownish gray, tinged with buff on the breast; tail
as in the male adult; naked skin round eye and on chin and throat
purplish. Iris brown; legs and feet dull black; bill and casque as
in the male. Length, 483; wing, 221; tail, 185; tarsus, 41.

"Young female with half developed casque differs from the adult
in having the under parts buff, edges of both the webs of the
tail-feathers margined with brown, and the upper tail-coverts and
the ends of the feathers suffused with bright buff." (Grant.)



296. PENELOPIDES TALISI Finsch.

NORTHERN TARICTIC.


    Penelopides talisi Finsch, Notes Leyden Mus. (1903), 23, 190;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 56.

    Talisi, native name.

    Luzon (van der Valk).


Adult male.--Appears to differ from P. manillæ in having no light
edges to the primaries and in the banding of the tail-feathers which is
as follows: Middle pair with a rust-colored cross-band, 25 mm. wide;
on the pair next to the middle the band only one-half as wide; on the
third pair only the inner web with small light rust-colored spots which
form cross-bands; two outermost tail-feathers on each side uniform
brownish black; upper mandible with four basal grooves. Length, 500;
wing, 243; tail, 220; bill, 95. [39]

This species was described from an adult male collected in Cagayan
Province, Luzon, February 23, 1892; if it is distinct from P. manillæ,
as seems quite probable, we have the interesting case of two species of
Penelopides resident in the same island. I have not examined birds
referable to P. talisi and the diagnosis is taken from Finsch's
description which will be found in the footnote.

A hornbill collected in Albay Province, Luzon, and recorded by Grant
as the young of P. manillæ, Ibis (1895), 261, is believed by Finsch
to be P. talisi.



297. PENELOPIDES MINDORENSIS Steere.

MINDORO TARICTIC.


    Penelopides mindorensis Steere, List Birds & Mams. Steere
    Exped. (1890), 13; Grant, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892), 17, 374;
    Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 65; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 56.

    Ta-ric-tic, Mindoro.

    Mindoro (Steere Exp., Schmacker, Bourns & Worcester, Everett,
    Whitehead, McGregor, Porter).


Male.--Crown, sides of neck, and under parts whitish; ear-coverts and
band across throat black; hind neck, back, rump, upper tail-coverts,
and wings black, glossed with dark green, some of the wing-feathers
edged with pale buff; tail chestnut, its terminal third black,
outermost feather with entire outer web and most of the inner web
black. Wing, 235; tail, 205; bill from nostril, 74.

Female.--Similar to the male but forehead blackish and black band on
upper throat wider. Wing, 235; tail, 210; bill from nostril, 77.

"Adult male.--Is most nearly allied to P. panini, but differs from
that species in having the belly and under tail-coverts white, the
rump and upper tail-coverts black glossed with green, like the rest
of the back, and the upper mandible only with transversely grooved
basal plates. From P. manillæ and affinis it differs (and resembles
P. panini) in having no black at the base of the tail. Length, 565;
wing, 246; tail, 203; tarsus, 43." (Grant.)

"Similar to P. manillæ, but black with bronze-green gloss instead of
brown as in P. manillæ. The whole base of the tail is light ferruginous
instead of this color being limited to a narrow bar as in P. manillæ,
and the lower mandible is plain instead of being chiseled as in
that species. The female of P. mindorensis has the feathers of the
head white as in the male, thus differing from the other Philippines
species, in all of which the females are black-headed.

"The males and females of P. mindorensis differ chiefly in the color
of the bare skin about the eye and base of the beak, this in life
being dark blue in the female and flesh-colored in the male." (Steere.)

"Habits like those of P. manillæ. All the Philippine representatives
of this genus have the peculiar undulating flight of woodpeckers when
going for any considerable distance. P. mindorensis is exceedingly
abundant in Mindoro." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



298. PENELOPIDES AFFINIS Tweeddale.

ALLIED TARICTIC.

    Dinagat (Everett); Mindanao (Everett, Koch & Schadenberg, Steere
    Exp., Goodfellow, Clemens, Celestino).


"Adult male.--Top of the head and neck yellowish white; cheeks,
ear-coverts, and feathered part of throat black; back, rump, upper
tail-coverts, and wings black, glossed with dark green; breast, belly,
thighs, and under tail-coverts white, tinged with buff; tail white
(stained rufous), with a wide terminal black band and some black
at the base of the feathers, sometimes a band nearly as wide as at
the extremity. 'Naked skin round eye and on chin and throat white;
iris crimson; feet greenish lead; nails grayish black; basal half
of bill and casque dark brown, rest of bill pale brown; base of the
lower mandible with three or four obliquely transverse yellow ridges
separated by dark brown grooves.' (Everett.) Length, 500; wing, 236;
tail, 195; tarsus, 41.

"Young male (with undeveloped casque) differs from the adult in having
the upper tail-coverts chestnut and the black band across the end of
the tail suffused with rufous.

"Adult female.--Head, neck, and under parts dull black; back,
rump, upper tail-coverts, and wings black, glossed with dark
green; tail resembles that of the male. 'Naked skin round eye and
on chin and throat dark blue: iris crimson, feet dark greenish
leaden.' (Everett.) Bill and casque brown, base of lower mandible
with indistinct obliquely transverse grooves. Length, 500; wing, 218;
tail, 175; tarsus, 41.

"Young female (with undeveloped casque) differs from the adult in
having chestnut upper tail-coverts and the black band across the end
of the tail suffused with rufous." (Grant.)



299. PENELOPIDES BASILANICA Steere.

BASILAN TARICTIC.

    (1906), 56.

    Basilan (Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


"Much like P. affinis of Mindanao, but differs from it in having the
rufous upon the tail reaching to and beneath the upper tail-coverts,
so that the whole base of the tail appears rufous, though some
specimens show some black at the bases of the feathers when they are
uncovered. The sides of the mandible are also flesh-colored to their
bases instead of being black behind as in P. affinis." (Steere.)

"The differences enumerated by Steere between this species and
P. affinis, though slight, occur in all the specimens secured by us. A
male measured, 610 in length; wing, 231; tail, 205; tarsus, 45; middle
toe with claw, 46. A female, length, 559; wing, 211; tail, 183; tarsus,
39; middle toe with claw, 45. Eyes red to umber-brown; legs and feet
greenish slate-color; nails black; bill white at tip, black on crest,
remainder mottled with reddish brown." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Male.--Very similar to the male of P. affinis but upper tail-coverts
very pale buff. Wing, 260; tail, 230; bill from nostril, 90.

Female.--Like the female of P. affinis. Wing, 235; tail, 225; bill
from nostril, 72.

"A well-marked species. Five males average, 606 in length; wing, 232;
tail, 208; tarsus, 42; middle toe with claw, 52. Eyes reddish brown;
legs and feet slaty black; nails brown to black; bill dark brown,
reddish at the tip and around grooves.

"It seems probable that Everett's Dinagat birds were of this species,
but they can, of course, be placed here only provisionally." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

nails black; legs dark flesh. Length, including long tail-feathers,
about 300. Three males from Mariveles, Luzon, measure: Wing, 117 to
118; tail, without long feathers, 87; bill from nostril, 34 to 36.

"Young.--Differs from the adult in being duller and greener, the red
of the head being overshaded with green and the mantle and upper back
green; the under surface is paler, the throat and abdomen pale blue
and the breast light green." (Sharpe.)

"Nest.--Nests in level sandy strips of ground. The tunnel is some 50
mm. in diameter at its mouth and at first runs sharply downward. When
a depth of 60 to 90 cm. has been reached it turns and slopes gradually
upward for 120 to 150 cm. of its length, ending in an enlarged chamber
in which the eggs are deposited on the bare sand. The eggs are pure
white and highly polished. They are frequently nearly spherical. They
vary from 21 to 24 in length by 18 to 20 in breadth.

"Sometimes feeds singly, but is more usually found in small flocks, and
at times very large flocks gather, apparently attracted by swarms 36;
tarsus, 11; middle toe with claw, 20. Eight females, length, 267; of
bees. Six males average, 282 in length; wing, 114; tail, 100; culmen,
wing, 112; tail, 91; culmen, 34; tarsus, 11; middle toe with claw,
19." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

tail-coverts cerulean-blue; a narrow line of blue across forehead,
ending on each side over posterior border of eye; a broad black band
from nostril through eye to and including ear-coverts; chin light
yellow; a wide chestnut band on throat; breast, sides, and abdomen
green, mixed with ocherous-buff and touches of pale greenish blue;
vent and under tail-coverts delicate sky-blue; wings and tail nearly as

    Basilan (Bourns & Worcester, Celestino); Luzon (Lindsay,
    Möllendorff, Steere Exp., Whitehead, Celestino); Mindanao (Everett,
    Celestino); Mindoro (McGregor, Porter).


Adult (sexes alike).--Head light chocolate-brown, very finely
vermiculated with gray and buff; along middle of head and on ear-tufts
a number of large black spots; lower feathers of ear-tufts pure black;
a rusty collar on neck continued on sides of neck and connected with
the white spot on each side of throat; sides of face and ear-coverts
black, vermiculated with cinnamon; wings, coverts, and back variously
mottled and splotched with black, ocherous-buff, and cinnamon;
scapulars with large black terminal spots; primaries, secondaries,
and lesser coverts black with dark cinnamon vermiculations; a few
of the median coverts with buff spots on tips; rectrices black
with a few irregular mottled bars of dark buff; feathers of lower
parts black, on chin and crop with narrow cross-lines of cinnamon,
on breast tipped with wide bands of dark buff, on abdomen and sides
tipped with narrower bands of light buff; under tail-coverts largely
buff with irregular black cross-lines. "Iris brown; bill clear brown,
tip black; feet clear brown, their scales darker brown." (Celestino.)

Length of a male from Mindoro, 348; wing, 275; tail, 170; exposed
culmen, 10; tarsus, 18; middle toe with claw, 29. Length of a female
from Bataan Province, Luzon, 368; wing, 290; tail, 180; exposed culmen,
9; tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw, 29.

The crown is often largely rufous, again it may be ochraceous and the
variations involve other portions of the plumage. The bars of the tail
are variable, sometimes fairly regular and at other times much broken.

"We obtained a single male specimen of this fine goatsucker in
Basilan. Iris very dark brown; bill black at tip, lighter at base;
eyelids black; legs flesh-color, shading to dark brown on the toes;
nails dirty grayish. Length, 343; wing, 276; tail, 223; tarsus, 16;
middle toe with claw, 29; culmen, 13." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"If these two forms [L. macrotis and L. mindanensis], the types of
which are before me, are really distinct species, then both occur
in north Luzon, for out of four specimens of Lyncornis sent by
Mr. Whitehead, three are typical L. macrotis, perfectly similar to
Vigors's bird, and the fourth agrees perfectly with Tweeddale's types
of L. mindanensis. Personally I am inclined to believe that the latter
are merely younger examples of the same species. The darker head and
shorter wing may be characteristic of youth, as it seems unlikely
two closely allied forms should occur in the same locality." (Grant.)

Whitehead thus describes the habits of this species: "Fairly common in
the lower valleys in the mountainous districts of north Luzon. This
species has the pretty habit of its Malay cousin L. temmincki. Just
at the last moment of the tropical day, when the highest heavens
are tinged with the soft light of the setting sun, Lyncornis leaves
its bed among the dead leaves and grass and flies high into the air,
rising and descending with vertically held wings, uttering every now
and then its pretty whistle, 'tet-a-bow, tet-a-bow.' But soon when the
last rays have ceased to gild the sky, it descends to mother earth
to feed on winged insects, its pretty note being then exchanged for
a frog-like croak. Toward sunrise Lyncornis once more rises to the
heavens and utters the same 'tet-a-bow,' but it shortly dives to the
ground, and rests unseen until the evening light again tempts it from
its concealment."



Genus CAPRIMULGUS Linnæus, 1758.


Wings long and pointed, first primary shorter than second; rictal
bristles conspicuous, no ear-tufts on sides of head; males generally
distinguished by having large white spots on wings and tail.

    Porter); Negros (Keay); Sibuyan (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


Adult male.--Upper parts finely vermiculated with blackish brown,
pale buff, and gray, more heavily marked with blackish brown on top of
head and on scapulars, some of the latter with wide edges of fulvous
or buff on outer web; an obsolete collar of buff on hind neck; lower
parts finely marked with blackish brown, buff, and whitish buff; a
large white patch on each side of throat; some of the breast-feathers
with rather large, pale buff, terminal spots; lower breast, flanks,
and abdomen buff, rather narrowly barred with brown, less closely
barred posteriorly; under tail-coverts very pale buff or white and
unbarred; inner primaries, primary-coverts, and outer secondaries
strongly barred with rich fulvous; first primary with a large white
spot reaching shaft; second, third, and fourth primaries each with a
buff-margined white spot crossing both webs and involving the included
section of shaft; exposed portion of each of the two outer pairs of
rectrices with a large terminal white area, a dusky wash near the
tip; rectrices barred basally with buff and dark brown. A male from
Mariveles measures: Length, 228; wing, 170; tail, 103; tarsus, 18;
middle toe with claw, 25.

Adult female.--Differs from the male in lacking the terminal white
area on tail-feathers which are barred and mottled with pale buff and
dark brown; on the outer feather there is an ill-defined light buff
area at tip of inner web. A female from Mariveles measures: Length,
228; wing, 164; tail, 100; tarsus, 18; middle toe with claw, 26.

Young.--Upper parts blackish brown, very finely vermiculated with white
and lacking the black blotches and fulvous edges to scapulars which
are present in the adult plumage; under parts about the same shade
of gray as in the adult but more finely and more uniformly mottled
and barred and without fulvous or buff spots on breast; white spots
on throat just indicated; wings and tail similar to the adult.

Eggs.--Whitehead took two eggs of this species at Cape Engaño,
Luzon, May 26, 1895, which he described as follows: "Shape elliptical
oval; ground-color pale creamy white, with very pale lavender-gray
under-markings and very pale brownish over-markings; the blotches and
markings, none of which are very large, are unevenly distributed over
the whole surface; measurements 31 by 22 mm. The eggs were placed on
the sand just above high water mark among sea drift, which, in this
instance, consisted of huge tree trunks. Both birds were seen and
identified beyond doubt." (Grant and Whitehead.)

The gray nightjar appears to be confined to the vicinity of sandy or
shingle beaches and while abundant in the localities where it has been
discovered the species has been recorded from but few islands and the
female and young have been but recently described. The description
of the eggs was published two years before that of the female.

Clarke says with feeling that the female "is not an easy specimen
to describe," but it is much easier to describe a single specimen
than to write anything that will apply to the variations which occur
in the species. In using the descriptions given above considerable
allowance must be made for variation in the shade of buff or fulvous;
this refers particularly to the scattered spots on breast, the broad
edgings of scapulars, and the rusty bars on primaries, primary-coverts,
and secondaries, all of which vary from a light buff (even almost white
on edges of scapulars) to rich fulvous. These variations are probably
due to age, the parts becoming darker with successive molts. In two
females from Mariveles, Luzon, the buff spot on first primary does
not reach the shaft.



307. CAPRIMULGUS MINDANENSIS (Mearns).

MINDANAO NIGHTJAR.


    Caprimulgus affinis mindanensis Mearns,
    Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. (1905), 18, 85.
    Caprimulgus mindanensis McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 57.

    Mindanao (Mearns).


"Adult male.--Similar to Caprimulgus affinis but differing as
follows: General coloration darker. Upper parts hair-brown, finely
vermiculated and dotted with clove-brown, light gray, and black;
scapulars marked with broken spots of cinnamon; first four primaries
barred across their middle with pure white except the outer web of
the first primary, this band varying from 12 to 24 mm. in width on
the differing feathers, widest on the fourth; outer tail-feather white
only on the terminal half, the basal half being cinnamon, clouded and
irregularly cross-banded with brownish black, and the tips of both
webs clouded with brownish black; second feather similar, but with
much less of the dusky clouding at tip; lower abdomen and thigh-coverts
cross-banded with pale sepia-brown; under tail-coverts and anal region
buff, without cross-bands; upper third of tarsus feathered. Length
of skin, 205; wing, 163; tail, 100; culmen, 8; tarsus, 19.

"Individuals vary greatly in the character and size of the punctate
and vermiculate markings of the upper surface. The vague black
cross-bands of the middle pair of tail-feathers are somewhat V-shaped
(open apically), numbering about eight.

"In true affinis, adult males have the outer tail-feather all white,
and the lower abdomen, thigh-coverts, and under tail-coverts 'uniform
pale fulvous buff.' In C. affinis griseatus the bars are spread over
the whole of the lower abdomen, thighs, and lower tail-coverts, and
the color is more grayish rufescent than in C. affinis mindanensis,
which appears to be closest to the form of C. affinis inhabiting
Celebes." (Mearns.)

    (McGregor, Porter); Negros (Keay); Palawan (Platen); Romblon
    (McGregor); Ticao (McGregor).


Male.--General coloration and pattern very much as in C. macrurus;
post-auricular area and band on hind neck light buff; white area on
throat divided, forming two patches; fore breast darker with no rufous;
barring on abdomen and under tail-coverts broken, resulting from the
larger light tips. The following characters are diagnostic; white spot
on first primary washed with buff, small and reaching but half way to
shaft; spot on second quill a little larger, not reaching shaft and
a narrow line indicates spot on outer web; spots on third and fourth
quills reaching shaft on both webs and on the fourth the included
section of shaft nearly all white; outer pair of rectrices with white
area about 32 mm. in length and on inner web only; second pair with
white area across both webs. A male from Romblon measures: Length,
255; wing, 170; tail, 125; tarsus, 15; middle toe with claw, 24.

Female.--Spots on first and second primaries dark fulvous; spot on
third primary not reaching shaft; otherwise like the male. A female
from Romblon measures: Length, 255; wing, 167; tail, 115; tarsus,
15; middle toe with claw, 24.

Young.--Upper parts very much as in the adult, but the blackish brown
spots on head and scapulars greatly reduced in size; as a whole the
upper parts are dark silvery gray; white throat patches wanting, being
indicated by two small buff areas; feathers of breast vermiculated
with light brown and light buff with lighter buff tips; abdomen and
flanks light fulvous, distinctly barred with brown; the partially
developed wings and tail with markings as in the adult.

Eggs.--A set of two eggs collected May 22, 1895, by Whitehead near
Cape Engaño, Cagayan Province, Luzon, are described as follows:
"Shape elliptical oval; ground-color pale cream; under-markings
pale lavender-gray; irregularly blotched over-markings pale brown,
but darker than in C. griseatus. In one egg the over-markings are
almost wanting, being reduced to one or two blotches. Measurements
29 mm. by 22." (Grant and Whitehead.)

The Manila nightjar is the most common species of its genus in the
Islands and has a considerable vertical range, being found in the
pine woods of Benguet Province as well as in the lowlands and near the
sea. Its food consists largely of moths and beetles which it takes on
the wing. During the day it rests in dark thickets and comes out to
feed only after sunset. Its presence in a locality may be detected
by hearing its peculiar note which has given it the Tagalog name
"tucaroc."



309. CAPRIMULGUS MACRURUS Horsfield.

HORSFIELD'S NIGHTJAR.


    Caprimulgus macrurus Horsfield, Trans. Linn. Soc. (1821), 13,

    Calamianes (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Palawan (Whitehead,
    Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino); Papuan Islands,
    northeastern Australia, Greater Sunda Islands, Java.


Male.--Forehead, crown, and nape grayish brown, finely vermiculated
with buff and brown, producing a nearly silvery appearance; down the
center of head to nape the feathers conspicuously marked with blackish
brown; an indistinct fulvous band across hind-neck connecting with a
bright fulvous patch on each side behind ear-coverts; back and rump
mottled with dark brown and a little fulvous; a large white patch on
throat, the longer feathers tipped with black, subterminally marked
with fulvous; sides of face, ear-coverts, chin, and a small area
posterior of white patch rich rufous with fine irregular black lines;
lower throat rufous, mottled with black; breast finely marked with
blackish brown and pale fulvous, a few feathers with large patches of
fulvous; abdomen, flanks, and under tail-coverts barred with brown;
wing-coverts blackish, each with a light fulvous terminal spot;
scapulars with black terminal spots and narrow fulvous subterminal
bars; white spot on first primary moderate and not reaching
shaft; on second, third, and fourth the white crosses both webs;
secondaries notched with dark rufous; tail-feathers blackish brown,
outer webs notched with fulvous; two outer pairs each with a large
white terminal area about 38 mm. long, involving both webs. A male
from Puerto Princesa, Palawan, measures: Length, 265; wing, 180;
tail, 140; tarsus, 16; middle toe with claw, 24.

"Female.--Differs from the adult male in having the outer web of
first primary spotted with rufous, in having pale rufous marks on
the primaries instead of white ones, in the white tips to the outer
rectrices being less in extent and tinged with buff or rufous,
speckled with brown on the tip of outer web.

"Young.--The markings are less developed in younger individuals;
the young male has the white patches on the primaries and rectrices
tinged with rufous and less in extent. The nestling is covered with
buffy down." (Hartert.)

"Iris dark brown, bill nearly black; legs and feet brown; nails
black. A male from Busuanga measures, 263 in length; wing, 184; tail,
135; culmen, 13; middle toe with claw, 22. A female from Palawan,
length, 250; wing, 222; tail, 135; culmen, 13; tarsus, 14; middle
toe with claw, 22." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



310. CAPRIMULGUS JOTAKA Temminck and Schlegel.

JAPANESE NIGHTJAR.


    Caprimulgus jotaka Temminck and Schlegel, Fauna Japonica, Aves
    (1847), 37, pl. 12; Hartert, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1892), 16,

    Hand-List (1906), 57; Oates and Reid, Cat. Birds' Eggs (1903),
    3, 74, pl. 1, fig. 14.

    Calayan (McGregor); Palawan (Bourns & Worcester, Celestino,
    White). Northeastern Siberia, China, Japan, Indo-Chinese provinces;
    in winter to New Guinea, Malay Peninsula, Greater Sunda Islands.


"Adult male.--Above gray, finely penciled with brown, with broad
black stripes along the top of the head, back, and rump; scapulars
with velvety black centers or spots and buff or rufous-buff spots
or bar-like markings; wing-coverts with roundish buff spots speckled
with brown; some longitudinal buff spots on the hind neck; a golden
buff spot on each side of neck, just behind ear-coverts; primaries
deep blackish brown, outer webs with some minute rufous spots, inner
web of first primary with a round white spot, not reaching shaft, a
white band across both webs of next three; central pair of rectrices
deep blackish brown, with broad pale grayish brown, dark speckled bars,
the others with narrower bands, becoming more rufous on the outer ones,
and all, except central pair, with a broad subterminal white bar; a
white band across throat, interrupted at center and variegated on lower
edge with ferruginous buff and blackish spots; throat pale rufous-buff
with brown cross-markings; chest and upper breast pale grayish brown,
with dark markings and some more or less developed larger buff spots;
abdomen buff, barred with dark brown, the bars becoming broader and
less numerous on lower tail-coverts which are sometimes nearly uniform;
rictal bristles dark toward the base. Length, 279; wing, 203 to 221;
tail, 140 to 147; tarsus, 16; feathered in front.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male, but a little smaller on the
average; spots on primaries buff and speckled, band on second primary
always interrupted; spots on throat buff; tail-feathers without a
distinct white band.

"Young.--Young individuals are paler above and below, the dark
markings less developed, and pervaded with a sandy rufous tinge;
the young male shows already the white spots of the adult male, but
they are shaded with buff and that on the second quill is a little
interrupted." (Hartert.)

Worcester and Bourns took a male of this species in Palawan in
December, 1891. It was 260 in length; wing, 212; tail, 128; culmen,
12; tarsus, 14; middle toe with claw, 22. The second Philippine
specimen was shot by my assistant in Calayan Island, the last day
of 1903. This specimen measures: Length, 260; wing, 210; tail, 127;
tarsus, 15; middle toe with claw, 21. Bill and legs brown; nails black;
the stomach contained several beetles and a large mantis.

The species appears to be a migrant from Asia and although not uncommon
in Calayan we secured but one specimen. The male is distinguished from
the other Philippine species by having a subterminal white tail-band;
the female is distinguished from the females of C. manillensis
and C. macrurus by the lack of a large white tail-spot and from
C. griseatus by the much darker plumage and larger size.

tarsus very short; tail short to moderately long, either square or
forked, and not reaching the tips of the folded wings. Diurnal in
habits; eggs pure white, two in number; nest composed of sticks and
moss, or else wholly or in part of a salivary secretion.



Families.


a1. Culmen equal to tarsus or greater; tufts of elongated feathers
above and below eye. ... Hemiprocniidæ (p. 350)
a2. Culmen decidedly less than tarsus; no elongated feathers anywhere
on head. ... Micropodidæ (p. 351)



Family HEMIPROCNIIDÆ.


Swift-like; wings long and pointed, tail deeply forked; feet stout;
tarsus shorter than middle toe without claw; colors largely blue and
brown with a slight metallic gloss; plumage of the sexes dissimilar;
at once distinguished from any nearly related family by the elongated
white feathers above and below eye. Habits more flycatcher-like
than swift-like.

Adult male.--Lores deep black; ear-coverts chestnut; a broad white
stripe from base of culmen, continued over eye and running out in
elongated feathers to nape; a similar white line under ear-coverts,
continued from the large white chin-patch; remainder of head and throat
dark metallic blue; back, rump, upper tail-coverts, breast, and sides
of body bronze-brown; middle of abdomen and under tail-coverts white;
wings and tail dark metallic blue; innermost secondaries white. Iris
dark brown; bill and legs black. A male from Mariveles, Luzon,
measures: Wing, 140; tail, 80; tarsus, 6.

Adult female.--Like the male but ear-coverts metallic blue instead
of chestnut. A female from Irisan, Benguet, Luzon, measures: Wing,
140; tail, 81; tarsus, 6.

"Curiously local in its habits. Perches in the same place day after
day, taking short flights from time to time in pursuit of insects. The
ground under its favorite perch is usually covered with excrement. Five
males average, 148 in length; wing, 129; tail, 73; culmen, 6; tarsus,
7; middle toe with claw, 12. Two females are somewhat larger, measuring

Family MICROPODIDÆ.


Wing long, pointed, and when closed extending far beyond the end
of tail; bill small and weak but gape very wide; legs and feet very
small and weak; plumage mostly black or dark brown, slightly glossy,
often with patches or mottlings of white; small birds capable of
long continued flight; nests usually placed in caves or fastened to
cliffs or houses; eggs two, white and unspotted. Certain species of
the genus Collocalia vel Salangana make the edible nests of commerce
and nest in great colonies. Birds of this family are wide ranging
and one or more species may be expected to occur in any island of
the Philippine group. Of the genera, Tachornis may be recognized by
its deeply forked tail; Chætura by its sharp, stiff tail-feathers;
Collocalia by its square, or nearly square, tail without spines;
Micropus by its white throat and tail without spines.

    (Whitehead, White); Verde (McGregor).


Adult.--Similar to Collocalia lowi in coloration but slightly larger
with the tail distinctly forked and the tarsi entirely devoid
of plumes. Iris brown; bill and nails black; legs dark reddish
brown. Measurements from ten skins of each sex from Irisan, Benguet
Province, are: Males, wing, pressed flat against the rule, 119 to 125;

lacking the green gloss; lower parts grayer. Iris dark brown; bill
and nails black; legs pale flesh.

Nest.--In Benguet Province, Luzon, eggs and nestlings were found in
June. The nests were made of green moss and placed in a water-worn
cave. The eggs are pure white. Two specimens measure, respectively,
22.3 by 13.9 and 23.6 by 14.2.



314. COLLOCALIA ORIGENIS Oberholser.

MINDANAO SWIFTLET.


    Collocalia origenis Oberholser,
    Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philad. (1906), 58, 191.

    Mindanao (Mearns, Celestino).


Adult.--"Upper surface uniform brownish black, the rump not lighter
but wings and the distinctly forked tail more brownish, their feathers
paler along the inner margins; entire ventral surface uniform smoky
hair-brown, the throat not paler; sides of head and neck darker brown
than the under parts; a blackish spot in front of the eye; lining of
wing blackish brown.

"In its large size, deeply emarginate tail, and lack of tarsal
feathering Collocalia origenis agrees with Collocalia whiteheadi,
but is readily distinguishable by the dark colors, particularly on the
upper parts which are even more blackish than in Collocalia fuciphaga
from the Philippines."

Oberholser gives measurements of two males as follows: Wing, 129, 138;
tail, 53, 60; exposed culmen, 6, 5.5; tarsus, 13, 14. Two females:
Wing, 134, 130; tail, 51, 54; exposed culmen, 5.5; tarsus, 12.5, 14.

"This new species was discovered by Doctor Mearns during his recent
trip to the Island of Mindanao, the four adults obtained having
been brought by natives who had found them in a cave on Mount
Apo." (Oberholser.)

Adult.--Very similar to Collocalia whiteheadi but the tarsi distinctly
feathered. Hartert gives the following description and measurements:
"Upper surface dark sooty brown with very little gloss; head,
wings, and tail darker and more glossy; feathers in front of the
eye whitish with dark brown tips; lower surface brownish gray with
darker shaft-stripes; under wing-coverts blackish brown. Total length,
about 114; bill at base, 4; wing, 112 to 119; tail, 56. The young
bird is like the adult in plumage." (Hartert.)

Adult.--Similar to Collocalia whiteheadi but easily recognized by
the whitish or smoky gray band across rump; shafts of rump-feathers
darker; tarsi unfeathered.

Young.--Probably the young bird is much like the adult, as with other
species of the genus.

"Four males from Culion measure, 112 in length; wing, 115; tail, 50;
culmen, 5; tarsus, 9; middle toe with claw, 9. Iris dark brown; legs

rump a white band 5 mm. wide, the shaft of each feather dusky; chin and
sides of face and neck dusky brown; feathers in front of eye white with
dusky tips; feathers of throat, breast, and abdomen with white tips
and dusky bases and shaft-lines, producing a mottled appearance, the
white predominating on the abdomen; under tail-coverts glossy black.

"Very common throughout the Islands. Builds edible nests. Nests always
in caves, and composed chiefly or entirely of secretion from the mouths
of the birds. When the birds are persistently robbed, however, they
seem to become discouraged, and mix in grass, stems of small plants,
moss, etc. Two or three white eggs are deposited. They measure:
15.2 to 17.7 by 10.1 to 10.9. Fourteen males from Siquijor average,
92 in length; wing, 92; tail, 41; culmen, 4; tarsus, 8; middle toe

    (McGregor); Polillo (Ickis [42]); Sibuyan (McGregor); Tablas
    (Celestino).


Adult.--Above very dark glossy green, short upper tail-coverts margined
with pure white; feathers in front of eye white with dusky tips; sides
of head, neck, and chin mouse-gray; feathers of throat with narrow
white edges, posteriorly the white edges gradually increase in width
so that the abdomen is almost entirely white; under tail-coverts dark
glossy green with narrow white margins; under wing-coverts narrowly
edged with white. Iris, bill, toes, and nails black; tarsi dark
flesh. Length, about 96. Five specimens of each sex from Calayan
measure: Males, wing, 102 to 107; tail, 40 to 46; females, wing,
102 to 105; tail, 41 to 42.

Young.--Two nestlings from Sibuyan are like the adult in plumage
except that the white edges to the upper tail-coverts are but just
indicated. Bill and nails black; legs pale flesh.

Nest.--Nests in small colonies, fastening the nests to the face of
a rock. The nest is composed of blackish brown hair-moss and held
together by the characteristic glutenous saliva. The eggs do not
differ from others of this genus being two in number and pure white
in color. The eggs of a set collected in Sibuyan, June 11, 1904,
measure 18.2 by 10.9 and 17 by 11.6 mm.

This species has been very rare in collections; the only specimen in
the British Museum in 1892 was a skin of doubtful locality collected
by von Othberg. We have met with it on several islands; in Sibuyan
and Calayan it was extremely abundant.

Adult.--Forehead, crown, nape, sides of head and neck, wings and tail
black with very dark steel-blue gloss; lores deep black; remainder
of plumage deep smoky brown, except under tail-coverts and a patch
on lower flank which are white; shafts of under tail-coverts dark
brown. A male from Palawan measures: Length, 239; wing, 203; tail,
67; exposed culmen, 10; tarsus, 17. A female from Culion measures:
Length, 229; wing, 200; tail, 68; exposed culmen, 9; tarsus, 16.

Worcester and Celestino collected a large series of giant swifts in
Culion and Palawan. I have seen large swifts in Benguet Province and
in Calayan, and Worcester observed a large flock in northern Luzon
which may have been either C. gigantea or C. dubia.

    Hand-List (1906), 59.

    Basilan (Mearns); Negros (Keay).  Celebes.


Adult.--"Deep steel-blue, back and rump with purple gloss; two white
spots on the sides of the forehead; sides of the abdomen and under
tail-coverts white. In size similar to C. gigantea." (Hartert.)

Clarke gives the following notes on a specimen obtained in Negros:
"The back is an admixture of dark brown, or brownish black, and deep
steel-blue, each feather having a broad subterminal band of blue with
an edging of dark brown, which conceals the blue to a considerable
extent, so that the brown predominates. The tail and secondaries are
glossed with green and blue in about equal proportions. Length, 241;
wing, 216; tail, 73; tarsus, 18."

"Female.--A specimen in the Sarasin Collection marked '[female]
juv.' (but we can not see any signs of immaturity) answers to
Mr. Hartert's description of the species, except that the lores are
reddish brown not white. Wing, 208; tail, 63; tarsus, 16; bill from
nostril, 6." (Meyer and Wiglesworth.)

Mearns gives the following measurements of two males from Basilan:
"Length, 240, 255; wing, 215; tail, 75; bill from frontal feathers
(chord), 8.5, 9.6; bill from anterior margin of nostril, 6.1, 7.1;
tarsus, 19, 20; middle toe with claw, 22.5."

But six specimens of this large swift are known, three from Celebes,
one from Negros, and two from Basilan.



322. CHÆTURA DUBIA McGregor.

PHILIPPINE SPINE-TAILED SWIFT.


    Chætura dubia McGregor, Bur. Govt. Lab. Manila (1905), 34, 15,
    pl. 12; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 59.

    Mindoro (McGregor).


Adult.--General color blackish brown; back and rump noticeably
lighter, being light seal-brown, each feather with a subterminal,
more or less concealed area or band of bluish violet; head and body
shot with bluish violet gloss, strongest on chin, throat, breast,
and sides of head and neck; a large white patch on each side between
nostril and lores; crissum white, each feather blackish brown at its
base, the long tail-coverts with edges also blackish brown except
near tip; extending diagonally upward and forward on each flank,
a wide white stripe connected with the white crissum behind as in
Chætura gigantea; exposed edges of wing-feathers black, inner webs
of primaries largely light brown; inner webs of alula, primary- and
secondary-coverts shot with greenish blue gloss; tertiaries greenish
blue; lining of wing brown, each feather bordered with dirty white
which has its greatest extent on innermost feather; axillars dark
brown, shot with bluish violet gloss, exposed portion of tail blackish,
the concealed basal portion glossed with green and blue. Bill black;
iris brown; legs and feet reddish flesh; nails light brown.

Male: Length, 229; wing, 220; tail, 64; bill from frontal feathers,
10; bill from anterior margin of nostril, 7; tarsus, 18. Female:
Length, 234; wing, 218; tail, 64; bill from frontal feathers, 10;
bill from anterior margin of nostril, 7; tarsus, 18.

This fine species is known from the type specimens, a pair taken
on the Baco River, Mindoro. It requires comparison with Chætura
celebensis. The following notes probably refer to Chætura dubia:

"We think it probable that C. gigantea will eventually be found in
Mindoro. We repeatedly saw a very large swift in that island, but
it always kept well out of range. We thought it to be C. gigantea
but could not, of course, be at all sure. On our first trip we found
C. gigantea flying low over the mangrove swamps in Palawan and had
no special difficulty in securing specimens. On our second trip,
however, we were less fortunate, as the few individuals that we saw
kept out of range." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Adult male.--Entire upper half of head black, strongly glossed with
blue on the crest; across the back of the neck a clear white collar;
back black, strongly glossed with greenish blue, and passing into
glossy olive-green on the scapulars and inner portion of wings;
remainder of wings chestnut, with brown ends to the quills; tail
glossy violet-black, most of the feathers, especially the outer ones,
partially tipped with white; throat chestnut-buff; chest buffy white;

"Nestling.--Differs from the adult in having most of the feathers
of the upper parts tipped with rufous, the collar being shaded
with rufous; the tail-feathers broadly tipped with pale sandy buff;
the throat buffy white like the chest, and the under tail-coverts
rufous-buff. Length, 350; wing, 160." (Shelley.)

"Apparently a stranger in the Philippines. A single specimen
was obtained by Everett in Mindanao. We obtained one specimen in

    Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino, White). Southern China,
    Malay and Indian Peninsulas, Burmese provinces, Ceylon, Java,
    Sumatra, Borneo.


Adult male.--Black; wings, upper and under tail-coverts, and tail
glossed with dark green; head, neck, back, and under parts glossed
with blue; a few hidden white feathers on occiput; a patch of
white feathers on each thigh; under tail-coverts narrowly barred
and tipped with white; a large white spot on inner web of first
primary; a diagonal white bar across inner webs of inner primaries;
outermost tail-feathers incompletely barred and tipped with white;
outer webs of three or four outer tail-feathers narrowly edged with
white near base. "Bill, legs, and claws black; gape and inside of
mouth orange-red; iris brown." (Shelley.) Length, 240; wing, 130;
tail, 122; culmen from base, 24.

Adult female.--Similar to the male. Wing, 120; tail, 112; culmen from
base, 21.

"Immature.--Slightly less glossy, of a more violet shade, and with
clear white terminal spots to many of the feathers irregularly
dispersed over the plumage; under wing-coverts irregularly barred
with white, and the white bar across the quills broader than in the
adult; the tail rather more barred with white, the white bars being
much more distinct on the outer feathers, and the penultimate ones
partially barred near their quills, and all the feathers with white
spots at their tips.

"This species varies considerably in the shape of the tail which is
sometimes very much forked, with the long feathers curved outwards
towards their ends, but is sometimes square, the outer feather on
each side being always short. The white of the nape is often absent,
and the amount of the white spotting of the upper tail-coverts varies
greatly. The most constant characters are the white spot and bar on
the under surface of the quills, the bars on the under tail-coverts,
and the bars on the outer tail-feathers, the latter varying in amount
according to age. The immature bird, Cuculus albopunctatus Drap. has
white spots which vary in number and size, the last to disappear with
age being those at the ends of the tail-feathers. * * *." (Shelley.)

"A single male from Palawan measures, 229 in length; wing, 119; tail,
120; culmen, 23; tarsus, 15; middle toe with claw, 19." (Bourns and

    (Bourns & Worcester); Tawi Tawi (Everett, Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult.--Very closely allied to S. lugubris; tail always square,
with the exception of the outer pair of feathers, which are much
shorter; it differs in having the head, back, throat, and breast
velvety black, with absolutely no trace of white on any of the

tail-feathers. 'Iris dark chocolate-brown; bill and claws black;
feet bluish gray.' (Everett.) Length, 203; culmen, 23; wing, 119;
tail, 109; tarsus, 14. The sexes are similar in plumage." (Shelley.)

"Immature.--A young bird from Basilan, two-thirds grown, is light

metallic blue-black feathers; one of the scapulars, many feathers of
rump, and all of tail same color, mostly tipped with rusty brown;
wing-coverts rusty brown with faint dark shaft-markings appearing;
upper surface of wing black, faintly metallic, all the feathers
edged with rusty brown; under surface of body uniform light brown;
wing-coverts white strongly washed with brown at tips; white spot on
inner webs of primaries appearing; under surface of tail dull metallic
blue, each feather with several spots of white.

"A bird nearly grown shows numerous brown feathers on head and

brown. Throat, chin, and upper breast nearly black. A third has general
color of adult but some feathers of head, nape, primary-coverts,
breast and abdomen as well as tips of some of the secondaries are
washed with rusty brown." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Abundant in Basilan; not uncommon in Tawi Tawi and Sulu. Found in
the forest, or in second growth. Five males average, 215 in length;
wing, 116; tail, 110; culmen, 23; tarsus, 15; middle toe with claw,

black to leaden; food insects." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus HIEROCOCCYX S. Müller, 1839-44.


Superficially this genus resembles Cuculus but differs by its
comparatively shorter primaries and longer secondaries. In plumage
and flight these cuckoos mimic the smaller Accipitrine hawks, and this
probably protects them from the attacks of the larger hawks and owls.

    Peninsula, Andaman Islands, Malay Archipelago, Burmese provinces,
    northeastern Australia, Japan, China, New Guinea, New Britain.


"Adult male.--Very similar to C. canorus, but smaller, with the bill
shorter and stouter. The plumage differs in the upper parts being
of a deeper and more blue-gray, the breast and under tail-coverts
more washed with buff, and the bars on the body black, broader and
more sharply defined than in C. canorus. 'Bill above blackish, below
greenish; gape and mouth inside deep orange; eyelids bright yellow;
iris stone-color; legs dull yellow; claws pale.' (Cripps.) Length,
325; culmen, 23; wing, 188; tail, 160; tarsus, 18.

"Adult female.--Differs only in plumage from the male in having the
base of the throat shaded with buffish rufous, as is the case in
C. canorus. Length, 292; culmen, 18; wing, 188; tail, 152; tarsus, 18.

"Nestling.--General plumage above blackish brown, with narrow terminal
white margins to the feathers, which margins are broadest on the wings
and tail; the white nuchal patch so characteristic of C. canorus
is indicated by three white feathers; a few rufous partial bars on
the wings and tail; chin and throat blackish brown, the feathers of
the latter with very narrow whitish terminal edges; remainder of the
under surface of the body blackish brown and white in broad bars of
even width. Length, 127; wing, 94.

"Young nearly full-grown.--Differs from C. canorus at this stage in

and in the greater breadth of the black bars on the throat and breast,
which are seldom narrower than the white space between them.

"Rufous phase.--Compared with the rufous phase of C. canorus, it
is darker, the dark bars being broader and blacker; lower back and
upper tail-coverts barred with black like the crown; tail with very
distinct black bars forming angles at the shafts of the feathers;
under surface of the body similarly colored, but much more broadly
barred with black than in C. canorus. Length, 282; culmen, 22; wing,
178; tail, 155; tarsus, 18." (Shelley.)



Genus PENTHOCERYX Cabanis, 1862.


"This genus resembles Cacomantis in structure and size, the only
structural distinctions being that the bill is much stouter and
broader up to the tip, which is blunt when seen from above, and that
the tail-feathers become narrower behind instead of remaining of the
same breadth. The wing is shaped as in Cacomantis, the primaries only
exceeding the secondaries by one-third the length." (Blanford.)

It is not improbable that Vigors's name will have to be used for the
violet cuckoo inhabiting the Philippine Islands, outside the Palawan

the separation is not available.

    Palawan (Platen, Steere Exp.). Malay and Indian Peninsulas,
    Burmese Provinces, Andaman Islands, Ceylon, China, Sumatra, Java,
    Borneo, Flores.


"Adult male.--Entire plumage black, very strongly glossed with bluish
green. 'Iris crimson; bill pale bluish green, dusky round the nostrils;
legs and feet leaden blue.' (Legge.) Length, 386; culmen, 30; wing,
193; tail, 200; tarsus, 30.

"Adult female.--Above blackish brown, with an olive gloss; crown,
sides of the head, and back of the neck very strongly mottled with
broad white shaft-stripes, which are generally shaded toward the
forehead with rufous; back and wing-coverts spotted with white;
quills, upper tail-coverts, and tail barred with white; beneath white,
feathers of the throat with broad black sides, remainder of the under
surface of the body and the under wing-coverts with rather broad black
angular bars; under surface of the quills brown, partially barred with
white. 'Iris crimson; legs and feet plumbeous; bill greenish gray,
gape pinkish flesh-color.' (Butler.) Length, 406; culmen, 30; wing,
190; tail, 198; tarsus, 33.

"Nestling.--Entirely greenish black like the adult male.

"The scarcely full-grown birds have more or less marking on the
tail-feathers and the under surface of the quills, and have numerous
fulvous spots on the body-feathers. In more than one specimen the
breast and abdomen are thickly mottled with buff markings.

"There seems to me to be no absolute uniformity in the color of
the young birds, and some are much more spotted than others. If
Mr. Whitehead's surmise is correct, that the young female is also black
like the male, then it is possible that the less spotted nestlings are
males, which remain almost uniform till they take on the adult plumage
after their first molt, while the feathers are even more mottled,
foreshadowing the spotted dress which they are about to assume. The
plumage of the adult female also varies, and very old birds appear
to me to grow hoary, while the yellowish or reddish tinge on the head
and throat may be considered as sure signs of youth." (Shelley.)

"Whitehead insists, Ibis (1890), 46, that the Palawan species is
E. mindanensis, and not E. malayana (honorata). Blasius, however, seems
to think that he found both species among Dr. Platen's birds. Steere
identified the specimens secured by us in 1897 as E. malayana. We
secured no additional material on our present trip." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

    339; Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 166; Grant, Ibis, (1896), 475;
    McGregor, Bur. Govt. Labs. (1905), 34, 17; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 63.

    Mindoro (Steere Exp., Everett, Platen, Schmacker, Bourns &
    Worcester, Whitehead, McGregor, Porter); Semirara (Worcester).


Adult (sexes similar).--Entire plumage black, heavily glossed with
oil-green; most of the feathers with glossy black shafts; in some
specimens the alula and primary-coverts edged with rufous. Iris dark
red; bill, legs, and nails black. Length of a male, 460; wing, 155;
tail, 270; culmen from base, 29; depth of bill at front of nostril, 13.

Young.--A young male taken May 11 is blackish brown; head and neck
glossed with green; chin, throat, and breast mottled with gray; wings
faintly glossed with green; primaries and secondaries slightly tipped
with dull rufous; alula and all upper wing-coverts barred with dull
rufous; tail black strongly glossed with green. Wing, 160; tail, 180;
culmen from base, 29.

Grant gives the following description of an immature male:

"The immature feathers in the upper parts are dull brownish black,
devoid of any gloss; the immature tail- and flight-feathers
are similarly colored, but slightly glossed, and the latter are
indistinctly barred with pale rufous on both webs. The throat, breast,
and belly are brownish black, indistinctly marked with buff; the rest
of the plumage is similar to that of the adult."

"Frequents bushes in open fields like C. viridis. Very common in
Mindoro. Four males average, 445 in length; wing, 167; tail, 268;
culmen, 37; tarsus, 35; middle toe with claw, 40. A female measures,
476 in length; wing, 176; tail, 279; culmen, 32; tarsus, 42; middle
toe with claw, 42. Iris red; bill, legs, and feet black. Food
insects." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

The Mindoro coucal builds a bulky globular nest of grass, with an
entrance on one side. A nest found in April was situated in a thick
bed of giant grass. The two eggs are dull white and covered with a
thin layer of a white, chalky substance; their measurements are 27.4
by 21.8 and 24.3 by 21.

The young plumage here described is usually considered to be put
on each winter even by birds that have attained the black adult
plumage. It is usually referred to as the "seasonal" or "non-breeding
plumage." Blanford, however, under the closely related Centropus
bengalensis says: "The second garb is called the winter or seasonal
plumage by most authors, but I can find no evidence that it is ever
assumed by birds that have once attained adult coloration, and there
are several winter birds in the British Museum collection with the
adult dress. The long upper tail-coverts appear peculiar to the
immature plumage." Fauna British India, Birds (1895), 3, 243.

"We record this species from Leyte and Bohol on the strength of
British Museum specimens stated in the Catalogue of Birds to have
been collected in these islands, though no mention seems to have been
made of them in the Marquis of Tweeddale's report on Mr. Everett's
collections.

"Quite common in Sulu and Tawi Tawi; not rare in the other islands
indicated. Lives in the grass in open fields. Iris very dark brown;
legs and feet blue-black; bill black. Food insects. Three males

blackish cross-band extending behind eye to ear-coverts; occiput and
nape bluish slate; rest of upper parts olive-green; superciliary line,
subocular line, chin, and throat light sulphur-yellow; lores, jaw,
and ear-coverts black; posterior to yellow throat a narrow crimson
band, followed by a narrower golden yellow band; remainder of under
parts pale yellow heavily streaked with dark green, lighter on middle

"Young.--Differs from the adult in wanting the scarlet on the head
and the bright colors of the under parts; uniform green above with
yellowish white edgings to wing-coverts and secondaries; a pale
yellow mark above and below eye; cheeks and ear-coverts blackish;
throat and abdomen pale yellow; fore neck and breast dull green,
the breast and sides of body narrowly streaked with green." (Shelley.)

"We heard a barbet on several occasions in Busuanga, but were unable
to procure any specimens. As X. hæmacephalum occurs in Mindoro,
it seems most probable that the Busuanga bird will prove to be of
this species. Called 'took-took' by the natives from its habit of
perching in the top of some tree and singing 'took, took, took' by
the hour. Sometimes called 'clock-bird' by the Spaniards, from the
regularity with which it utters its note.

"Seven males from Mindanao average, 158 in length; wing, 78; tail,

Young.--A young bird has the feathers of forehead and crown blackish
slate, tipped with olive-green; below eye a pale yellow band; greater
and median wing-coverts and inner secondaries tipped with pale yellow;
no crimson feathers; legs flesh-color; otherwise like the adult.

"Five males from Tablas average, 160 in length; wing, 79; tail, 36;

same place: Length, 160; wing, 78; tail, 33; culmen, 22; tarsus,
18; middle toe with claw, 20. Iris dark brown; legs and feet red;
nails black; bill black, except base of lower mandible, which is
gray." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Shelley gives the name Xantholæma intermedia to the Philippine bird
distinguishing it from the Javan form as having upper parts uniform
green with no pale edges to the feathers; cheek-band black in front,
passing into olive-gray down the sides of the red throat; under parts
more strongly marked with brighter green centers to the feathers. The
validity of this species is somewhat doubtful.

Adult male.--Above blackish brown; browner on forehead and crown;
ear-coverts brown; a wide white stripe from eye to nape; a very short,
narrow, red line on side of occiput; middle of throat white, with a
blackish line on each side and above this a white line; rest of under
parts white with a fulvous wash; breast with large blackish spots;
abdomen with blackish stripes; rump and upper tail-coverts white,

culmen from base, 20; tarsus, 14.

Female.--Differs from the male in having no red on sides of occiput. A
female from Bataan Province, Luzon, measures: Wing, 82; tail, 45;

"Dr. J. B. Steere, the first naturalist before whom a series of
specimens [of Yungipicus] from all these localities ever lay, saw
at once the differences between the Luzon and Panay birds, which
unfortunately he seems not to have thought worth pointing out, and
rightly retained the name 'maculatus' for the Panay species. The Luzon
birds he called 'validirostris,' with apparent reason as they most
certainly are not maculatus and the birds described by Blyth may well
have come from Luzon. The Mindanao-Basilan species he re-described
under the name 'Yungipicus basilanicus' overlooking Hargitt's name
and description entirely. * * * The other species of the genus found
in the Philippine Islands with the possible exception of that from
Samar and Leyte are so well-marked that no possibility of confusion
exists." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Quite common in Marinduque. Not abundant in the parts of Mindoro
visited by us, and no specimens were gathered by the Menage
Expedition. A female specimen in the Steere collection measures as
follows: Wing, 79; tail, 44; culmen, 17; tarsus, 14; middle toe with

Adult.--"Adult male and female differ from the male and female
of C. lucidus in having the mantle and wing-coverts orange with
scarcely a tinge of crimson. In the female also the top of the head

the males have narrow crimson-orange edges to the wing-coverts,
the general color of the wings is distinctly orange.

"This form may be regarded as a partially alpine representative of
C. lucidus, of which it is no doubt a subspecies; it also occurs
on the coast, for two fully adult male specimens were procured at
Piso." (Grant.)

Adult male.--Nasal tufts black; forehead, crown, occipital crest,
and malar stripe bright scarlet; feathers of forehead and crown with
white bases; feathers of crest with white bases; remainder of head,
chin, throat, breast, and entire upper parts black; feathers of lower

Young birds have the abdomen white, and the malar stripe entirely
black or with a few red spots.

"If the Luzon record of this species is correct, and we can see no
reason for doubting it, the distribution of T. javensis within the
Philippines is very peculiar. Why should it disappear in Samar and
Leyte, to reappear in Cebu and Luzon? There is not the slightest doubt
as to the identity of the Cebu birds, of which we have a fine series.

    Ma-nuc'-toc, Mindoro.

    Mindoro (Steere Exp., Schmacker, Bourns & Worcester, Everett,
    McGregor, Porter).


Adult.--Very much like T. javensis but clearly distinguished from
that species by having a wide light buff or white band across the
lower back; from T. hargitti it differs in having a more slender bill
which is entirely black. A female measures: Length, 394; wing, 215;
tail, 170; culmen from base, 47; bill from nostril, 35; width of bill
at base, 18; tarsus, 31.

    (Bourns & Worcester); Palawan (Steere, Whitehead, Platen, Steere
    Exp., Bourns & Worcester).


Adult.--Differs from T. javensis in having a wide band of light buff
across the lower back thus resembling T. mindorensis from which it
differs in having a much stouter bill and in having lower mandible
gray or horn-white; lower mandible in dry skin dull yellow with a
gray tip. In males the red malar-stripe is longer than in the other
species mentioned and many of the black feathers of chin and sides of
neck are tipped with red. Length of male, 420; wing, 220; tail, 180;
culmen from base, 51; bill from nostril, 38; width of bill at base,
20; tarsus, 36. Wing of female, 218; tail, 185; culmen from base,
52; bill from nostril, 38; tarsus, 33.

The description and measurements above are from specimens taken in
Masbate, one of the type localities of Thriponax philippinensis of
Steere. In Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum the type
locality of Thriponax hargitti is given as Palawan. Of these two
supposed species Grant says: "The types have been compared and agree
in all particulars." It seems to me almost incredible that this genus
should be represented by the same species in Masbate and Palawan but
as I have seen no specimens from the latter island I follow Grant's
identification.

"Iris yellow; legs, feet, and nails leaden; upper mandible black,
lower horn-gray. Three males average, 430 in length; wing, 207; tail,
174; culmen, 50; tarsus, 48; middle toe with claw, 39. Three females,
length, 410; wing, 204; tail, 169; culmen, 50; tarsus, 31; middle
toe with claw, 39." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Basilan (Steere, Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    McGregor); Dinagat (Everett); Mindanao (Steere Exp., Platen,
    Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


Adult male.--Forehead and crown deep purple; a few spots of scarlet
on occiput, not always present; feathers at base of bill with white
bases; lores black; a white collar around neck; hind neck, back,
and scapulars slate-gray; rump and tail-coverts chestnut, tipped
with purple; tail chestnut; chin, throat, and sides of head black;
breast, abdomen, and sides lilac, bases of the feathers white; middle
of abdomen white; under tail-coverts white, tinged with lilac; thighs
blackish gray; wings black; edge of wing and of first primary white;
a distinct bar of golden yellow on secondaries, changing to white
on inner secondaries; wing-lining black, axillars white. A male from
Basilan measures: Wing, 85; tail, 64; culmen from base, 22; bill from
nostril, 14; tarsus, 20; middle toe with claw, 22.

Adult female.--Similar, but under parts pure white except the black
chin and throat and gray thighs. A female from Basilan measures:
Wing, 86; tail, 64; culmen from base, 23; bill from nostril, 15;
tarsus, 20; middle toe with claw, 21.

"There has been some difference of opinion between Dr. Steere
and Mr. Everett as to the color of the eyes of this interesting
species. Both were right and there was abundant room for still more
divergence of opinion. The eyes of S. steerii are golden yellow, bright
green, or a beautiful blue according to the way the light strikes them.

"The young show some interesting plumage changes. An immature male has
the under surface white, some of the feathers tipped with pale lilac;
chin black but throat white, a few black feathers just appearing;
head as in adult but white nuchal collar much narrower; back and
wing-coverts washed with olive-green, the wing-bar being ill-defined
and paler than in adult; rump and tail as in adult. Bill as in adult
except center of upper mandible which is black.

"Another young male, slightly older, has chin and throat black,
the feathers narrowly tipped with white and shows more lilac on
breast. Crown, nape, and back washed with olive-green, purple appearing
on one or two feathers of forehead. Bill pure black.

"A young female is like the first young male described but without
lilac on under surface." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Usually found in deep woods in small flocks; once seen in a mangrove
swamp close to the sea. It usually takes short flights, making a
loud whir with its wings, and sits perfectly still for some time
after. When perched on a limb, it has a curious habit of snapping
its bill which produces a sound audible for some distance. Its food
consists of insects which it holds in its bill and raps several times
on a limb before swallowing. Its note is a plaintive whistle and it
may be readily decoyed by imitating its call. At the discharge of a
gun it does not fly away but sits perfectly still.

"Iris blue, green, or golden according to the light; bill, legs, feet,
and eye-wattle light blue; nails nearly white. Ten males from Basilan
average: Length, 174; wing, 84; tail, 60; culmen, 24; tarsus, 22;
middle toe with claw, 25. Ten females average: Length, 172; wing, 85;
tail, 87; culmen, 24; tarsus, 20; middle toe with claw, 24." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 68.

    Leyte (Whitehead); Samar (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    Whitehead).


"Adult male.--Much smaller than S. steerii. Head, back, and scapulars
purple somewhat mottled with brown; white nuchal collar very narrow
and ill-defined; purple of back gradually changing into brown on rump;
tips of scapulars black; upper tail-coverts and tail bright chestnut;
upper wing-coverts black; tertiaries barred across both webs with
pure white; three secondaries with lilac spot on outer webs; tips of
secondaries and tertiaries black; primaries blackish brown; chin,
throat, sides of face, ear-coverts, and lores pure black; breast,
abdomen, and flanks lilac, deeper on upper breast, lighter on abdomen;
thighs black, the feathers tipped with brown; under tail-coverts light
buff; axillars white; under wing-coverts black; bend of wing white.

"Female like male except that the lilac of under surface is replaced
by white. Bill, legs, feet, nails, and eyes exactly as in S. steerii
and the young show the same plumage changes as in that species.

"Average measurements from five males: Length, 153; wing, 78; tail,
62; culmen, 22; tarsus, 20." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Habits exactly like those of the preceding species; abundant in
Samar but irregularly distributed." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Order PASSERIFORMES.

PASSERINE BIRDS.


Bill hard and horny, never extensively membranous, softly tumid, nor
cered; nostrils without open communication; greater wing-coverts not
more than one-half the length of the secondaries; primaries usually
ten, more rarely nine; rectrices twelve, rarely ten; feet adapted
for perching; hind toe and claw well developed and inserted on the
level of the anterior toes; hind claw equal to, or longer than, the
claw of middle toe; anterior toes three in number, never versatile,
always free except when webbed or fused at base.

The order Passeriformes includes nearly as many species, among
Philippine birds, as all the other orders combined. Most of the species
of this order are less than 200, and very few of them are more than
300, millimeters in length. The small birds belonging to other orders
are extremely few. Most ornithologists consider the Passeriformes
to be the order of highest rank among birds, chiefly because of
the highly developed vocal powers of many of the species. In the
arrangement of the families of this order, the Turdidæ, Fringillidæ,
and Corvidæ have variously been assigned to the place indicating the
highest development.

Adult (sexes similar).--Head, sides of head, and neck reddish brown,
most intense on occiput; on each side of head a blackish brown band
from nostril to above eye; a blue collar, followed by a dull green
patch on mantle; back, rump, tail, and most of the wing blue; chin
brown, merging into black on fore breast, followed by a wide dull green
pectoral band which is more or less mixed with blue in its middle;
rest of under parts bright scarlet; longest under tail-coverts tipped
with blue; primaries black with blue tips, the third and fourth each
with a white spot half way between tip and base; wing-coverts blue,
a few of the outer lesser series with large white spots; tail blue
above, black below. Length, 160 to 180. A male from Romblon measures:
Wing, 97; tail, 35; culmen from base, 21; tarsus, 35. A female from
Bohol, wing, 97; tail, 36; culmen from base, 21; tarsus, 36.

Young.--The young bird is very different from the adult, particularly
in the coloring of the lower parts which are light earthy brown with
very little red on the abdomen; upper parts dull brown; as the bird
becomes older the adult plumage gradually makes its appearance; a
great number of specimens would be necessary to show all the changes
from young to adult.

"The red-breasted pitta is common throughout the islands; it is found
on the ground, usually in dark places in the forest and in second
growth. Ten males from Mindanao average: Length, 170; wing, 98; tail,
37; culmen, 22; tarsus, 34; middle toe with claw, 29. Six females
from the same place, length, 162; wing, 98; tail, 37; culmen, 22;
tarsus, 34; middle toe with claw, 29. Iris dark brown; legs, feet,
and nails dark brown; bill black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Nearly mature males of this red-bellied pitta were collected near
Cape Engaño. Mr. Whitehead is of the opinion, Ibis (1893), 505,
that Pitta propinqua Sharpe, is not specifically distinct from the
present species. The type of P. propinqua came from the Island
of Balabac, and since Mr. Whitehead examined the British Museum
series we have obtained, through Mr. Everett, an adult male from
the typical locality. This bird agrees perfectly with Dr. Sharpe's
original description, Trans. Linn. Soc. (1877), 1, 330, and differs
much from the typical examples of P. erythrogastra. It must, however,
be stated, that both forms were found by Mr. Whitehead in the Island
of Palawan, one of his specimens being almost typical P. propinqua,
and, given a larger series, we should probably find that the two forms
pass more or less one into the other in Palawan. Still P. propinqua
is a very well-marked insular form, and I consider Dr. Sharpe fully
justified in regarding it as distinct. Both he and Dr. Sclater are
certainly mistaken, however, in regarding the '[male] juv. Dumalon,
Mindanao,' collected by Prof. Steere, as the young of P. propinqua,
the Mindanao bird being typical P. erythrogastra." (Grant.)



380. PITTA PROPINQUA (Sharpe).

PALAWAN PITTA.

    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 68.

    Balabac (Steere, Everett); Palawan (Whitehead, Platen, Bourns &
    Worcester, Everett).


Adult.--"Back entirely cobalt, including the scapulars; only the middle
of the back green washed with blue, forming a band across the back;
throat entirely brownish black, becoming jet-black on the fore neck;
chest bright blue, the sides only greenish; under wing-coverts dull
blue." (Sharpe.)

"Dr. Sharpe founded his Brachyurus propinquus on an adult male bird
obtained by Dr. Steere in Balabac. Dr. Steere obtained a second
specimen of a red-bellied pitta, also a male, but in very immature
plumage, at Dumalon, near Zamboanga, in Mindanao, and this bird
Dr. Sharpe assigned also to be B. propinquus, though not without
hesitation. Owing to the meager material available, the validity of
this species has always been open to question; and hence I made a
point of securing a series of these red-bellied pittas from Balabac
and Palawan, with the result that it has at length become possible
to compare adult birds from Balabac with adult birds from Luzon,
Mindanao, and Palawan.

"The characters relied upon by Dr. Sharpe as distinguishing
P. propinqua from typical P. erythrogastra were: (1) Back entirely
cobalt, including the scapulars; only the middle of the back green,
washed with blue, forming a band across the back. (2) Throat entirely
brownish black, becoming jet-black on the fore neck. (3) Chest bright
blue, the sides only greenish. (4) Under wing-coverts dull blue,
instead of grayish brown.

"Of these characters the last three appear to be of no value, as
birds from Luzon and Mindanao present them in greater or less degree,
and I have come to the conclusion that they belong to the fully-adult
birds, from whatever locality. But on viewing the upper surfaces of
a series of Balabac-Palawan specimens side by side with a series of
Luzon-Mindanao birds, the first mentioned character is at once seen
to be a good one, the green tract on the back of the former series
forming a comparatively narrow band, whereas in the latter series
it extends nearly to the rump. It is noticeable, further, that the
cobalt and green hues are much brighter than in any of the specimens
from Luzon or Mindanao, though it is no doubt very possible that this
may be owing to the freshness of the Balabac-Palawan skins.

"I have, therefore, no longer any doubt that P. propinqua differs
sufficiently from P. erythrogastra to make it necessary that it
should be separated from the latter by the appropriate appellation
which Dr. Sharpe originally bestowed upon it. And in this case it
will follow that the locality 'Mindanao' given in the 'Catalogue of
Birds' will require correction, as, indeed, it would in any case,
for the type was described from Balabac." (Everett.) [51]

"This species was based on a specimen in the Darmstadt Museum, of
which Mr. Gould gives the subjoined description:

"'General color above dull olive-brown, with somewhat of a ruddy tint
on the sides of the neck and mantle; wing-coverts lilac-gray, the
primary-coverts and quills blackish brown; the primaries externally
grayish towards their ends; the secondaries and inner greater coverts
olive-brown, washed with lilac-gray on the outer webs; the second,
third, and fourth primaries with a large white spot on the inner web,
the last-named having the white spot on the outer web as well; upper
tail-coverts and tail lilac-gray, the latter darker; forehead and
crown, as well as the lores, region of the eye, and ear-coverts dark
brown, the latter slightly shaded with an olive tinge; nape and hind
neck dull red; cheeks ashy brown, with a bluish shade under certain
lights, forming a very broad moustache; throat reddish in the center,
brown on the sides, forming a malar stripe; the fore neck red with
a tinge of lilac; chest lilac-gray, the sides olive-brown; remainder
of under surface of body scarlet; the sides olive-brown, with which
color the center of the abdomen is washed; under tail-coverts scarlet,
the longer ones tipped and edged with lilac-blue; thighs ashy gray;
under wing-coverts dull lilac-blue, some of the outer ones tipped with
white; axillars olive-brown, like the back; quills ashy brown below,
relieved by the before-mentioned white spots on the primaries. Length,
190, culmen, 30; wing, 119; tail, 56; tarsus, 53.'

"The large size and dark brown ear-coverts are the distinguishing
features of this pitta." (Sclater.)

"Immature female.--Top of the head rather dark brown, shading gradually
into a more rufous tint on the nape; all the feathers have rather
darker margins, giving these parts a slightly scaled appearance;
a few of the dull red feathers of the adult are beginning to make
their appearance; the dark olive on the rest of the upper parts has
a somewhat browner shade, though here and there some of the greener
feathers of the adult plumage may be seen; the grayish blue of the
outer wing-coverts and outer webs of the secondaries is replaced by
dull olive, and the slate-blue of the upper tail-coverts and tail
is not so bright; the ear-coverts are brown, with buff centers;
the moustache stripes dirty white, devoid of that reddish shade
characteristic of the adult plumage; the chin and throat-feathers with
white centers and black margins and bases, those on the fore neck
being conspicuously white, washed with reddish; the chest-feathers
are whitish buff, with here and there a few slate-blue feathers;
rest of the under parts dirty whitish buff, most of the feathers,
especially those on the sides and flanks, margined with brownish
buff; a few pale scarlet feathers indicate the colors of the adult,
but are much less brilliant.

"In more advanced examples the upper parts entirely resemble
those of the fully adult bird, but the slate-blue on the wings is
almost wanting; the fore neck and chest are still intermixed with
white-and-buff centered feathers, and on the rest of the under parts
the scarlet feathers of the adult and the whitish buff of the juvenile
plumage are represented in about equal parts.

"It is difficult to imagine anything more glorious than the colors
of the fully adult male, the brilliant scarlet of the lower breast
and belly contrasting vividly with the shining slate-blue chest.

"The adult female differs from the male only in having the colors of
the under parts rather less brilliant." (Grant.)

Koch's pitta is known only from the highlands of northern Luzon.

    Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester).


Adult (sexes similar).--Entire head, neck, chin, and throat velvety
black; back and greater part of the wings green, changing with the
light; rump and tail-coverts shining silvery blue; tail black, tipped
with green; breast and sides bluish green; a large black patch on
middle of abdomen; lower abdomen and under tail-coverts bright red;
primaries white with black bases, the four or five outer ones with
narrow black tips; secondaries black, tipped with green on upper
surface; primary-coverts and alula velvety black; lesser and median
coverts shining silvery blue. Iris brown; bill black; legs and nails
dirty brown. Length, about 180. A male from Romblon, wing, 110; tail,
35; culmen from base, 25; tarsus, 40. A female from Tablas, wing,
102; tail, 34; culmen from base, 26; tarsus, 37.

The amount of white on the outer primaries varies to a great extent;
in females it is usually much less than in males.

"The black-headed pitta is called 'wow-ha' by the natives from its
note. Iris dark brown; legs, feet, and nails very dark brown; bill
black. Twelve males average: Length, 169; wing, 103; tail, 39; culmen,
25; tarsus, 36; middle toe with claw, 32. Three females, length, 167;
wing, 100; tail, 37; culmen, 25; tarsus, 36; middle toe with claw,
32." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Whitehead secured a nest of the black-headed pitta near Paranas,
Samar, on June 30, 1896. The egg is thus described:

"Shape rounded ovate. Ground-color pure white, thickly speckled
all over with brown and larger underlying spots of french-gray,
the latter being most numerous round the larger pole. Measurements
26 mm. by 21 mm.

"The nest with two slightly incubated eggs (one of which was broken)
were brought by a native, together with the parent birds. The somewhat
bulky nest was composed outwardly of twigs and lined with moss." (Grant
and Whitehead.)

    Sibutu (Everett). Borneo, Sumatra, Banka.


"Similar to P. atricapilla, but of rather larger
dimensions." (Sclater.)

Writing of Pitta atricapilla and P. mulleri Sharpe [53] says: "These
two birds are closely related; but the Bornean species [mulleri]
almost entirely wants the black patch on the belly, and has the thighs
blackish instead of ochraceous brown."



384. PITTA ROTHSCHILDI (Parrot).

ROTHSCHILD'S PITTA.


    Pitta atricapilla rothschildi Parrot, Abhandl. K. Bayer
    Akad. Wiss. (1907), 24, 223.

    Marinduque (Steere Exp.).


Male.--Related to Pitta atricapilla from which it is said to differ
in having the under parts suffused with blue so that there is hardly
a trace of green remaining; white of the wing-quills much reduced;
chest-spot relatively small; and the color of the vent-feathers bright
carmine-red not cinnabar-red. [54]



385. PITTA STEERI (Sharpe).

STEERE'S PITTA.

    Pitta steerei Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 184.
    Pitta steeri McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 68.

    Bohol (McGregor); Mindanao (Steere, Everett, Steere Exp.); Samar
    (Steere Exp., Whitehead).


Adult (sexes similar).--Entire head and neck and their sides black;
upper parts green; rump light blue; tail and its coverts black;
chin and throat white; rest of under parts light blue, except a band
of velvety black down middle of breast, and the bright scarlet of
crissum; thighs gray; primaries black, some of them with small white
spots near the middle; secondaries green; alula and primary-coverts
black; secondary-coverts shiny silvery blue. Iris brown; bill black;
legs gray. Length, about 190. A male from Bohol measures: Wing, 115;
tail, 38; culmen from base, 26; tarsus, 42. A female measures, wing,
115; tail, 38; culmen from base, 27; tarsus, 40.

Sclater says: "It is impossible to mistake this noble species,
distinguished at once by its pure white throat and silvery blue
under surface."

"The plumage of some of the young birds, being in an interesting stage
of transition, is worth describing. The youngest example, a male, has
the upper parts and wings like those of the adult, but the breast,
sides, and flanks are of a dirty, grayish olive, only one or two of
the silver-blue feathers being visible, and the entire middle of the
breast and belly are pale scarlet. A rather older bird is similar to
the above, but down the sides and middle of the breast are three lines
of pale blue feathers. In both specimens these are being attained by
molt. In the middle of the breast a tuft of the black adult feathers
is making its appearance amongst the red, and some of the latter
appear to be turning black without a molt. * * *." (Grant.)

Steere's pitta is by no means common in any of the islands where it
has been found. In Bohol it was collected in forests of small trees
growing on coral-limestone hills and Whitehead found the species on
similar ground in Samar.

black; throat white; lower throat, breast, abdomen, and flanks ruddy
buff, most intense on breast; vent, under tail-coverts, and middle
of abdomen bright red; tail black, tipped with dull blue; primaries
black, each feather with a white patch, mesial and smallest on first,
reaching tip on seventh; secondaries black, edged with dull blue
on terminal half; alula, primary-coverts, axillars, and wing-lining
black. A male measures: Wing, 119; tail, 38; culmen from base, 26;
bill from nostril, 17; tarsus, 39. A female from Basilan (type of
Pitta fastosa) measures: Length in flesh, 190; wing, 117; tail, 40;
culmen from base, 28; bill from nostril, 18; tarsus, 36.

The type of Pitta fastosa McGregor proves to be a specimen of
P. moluccensis. This species is migratory.

391. HIRUNDO GUTTURALIS Scopoli.

EASTERN SWALLOW.

    Worcester); Sulu (Bourns & Worcester); Ticao (McGregor). Malay
    Peninsula and Archipelago, Indo-Chinese provinces; central and
    eastern Siberia, China, Japan, New Guinea, Australia.


Adult (sexes similar).--Forehead, chin, and throat dark chestnut,
lores black; upper parts dark steel-blue; feathers of hind neck and
upper back with much white basally; sides of head and neck, and a
broad, more or less interrupted, band on breast steel-blue; rest of
under parts white, sometimes tinged with pale salmon-pink; wings and
tail black, glossed with green; each of the rectrices except middle
pair with a large white spot on inner web. Length, about 175; wing,
118; tail, 90; depth of fork, 47; bill from nostril, 6; tarsus, 10.

Young birds have the forehead, chin, and throat brown or whitish,
and the breast-band and sides of head earthy brown.

Typical specimens of the common and eastern swallows are no doubt
very distinct, but the two forms appear to intergrade so that some
authors have rejected the latter species, although it seems now
to be generally recognized. Sharpe says in part: "If one accepts
the broken pectoral collar as the best sign of distinction between
H. gutturalis and H. rustica, it will be found to be so only in the
majority of specimens, and by no means invariably; in fact there is
as much variation with H. gutturalis in the direction of a complete
collar on the fore neck as there is in H. rustica in that of a broken
collar. Again, although the majority of H. gutturalis have a white
under surface, still this is not an unfailing character of the eastern
race; for many undoubted examples are rufescent below, although there
is never such a decided tint of rufous as in full-plumaged H. rustica."

Adult (sexes similar).--Lores black; entire forehead, chin, throat,
and fore breast chestnut-rufous; upper parts including wings and
tail glossy steel-blue, feathers of neck and back with white bases;
breast, abdomen, under tail-coverts, sides, and axillars ashy brown,
whitish on abdomen; longest tail-coverts with white tips and black
subterminal bars; rectrices, except middle pair, with white spots on
inner webs. Length, about 140. Male, wing, 109; tail, 53; depth of
fork, 12; bill from nostril, 7; tarsus, 9. Female, wing, 107; tail,
51; depth of fork, 7; bill from nostril, 7.

Young birds have the chin, throat, and breast much lighter, upper
parts with less gloss, and the forehead black like the crown with no
green gloss.

The Asiatic swallow is abundant and widely distributed. It makes a
crescent-shaped nest of mud which it fastens to a rock-cliff or to a
beam under a building. Three heavily incubated eggs were collected
in Bohol in July. They are white, dotted with reddish and blackish
brown, and with a few under shell-markings of lavender; they measure
17.7 by 12.4



393. HIRUNDO STRIOLATA (Boie).

MOSQUE SWALLOW.


    Cecropis striolata Boie, Isis (1844), 174.
    Hirundo striolata Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1885), 10,
    161; Hand-List (1901), 3, 196; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 236
    (migration in northern Luzon); McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List

    N. (McGregor); Cebu (McGregor); Luzon (Whitehead); Masbate
    (Bourns & Worcester); Mindoro (Porter). Formosa, southern China,
    Burmese provinces, Java, Assam, Flores, Cachar.


Adult (sexes similar).--Above, except rump, dark steel-blue; loral
feathers black with gray bases; a more or less triangular patch
above and behind ear-coverts chestnut, streaked with black, continued
forward over eye and slightly connected across occiput by fine lines
of chestnut; feathers of neck and upper back largely white basally,
this showing as white lines; under tail-coverts black; remainder
of under parts including axillars and wing-lining white, or very
pale fawn, with conspicuous blackish shaft-lines producing a very
striking appearance; rump rusty chestnut with blackish shaft-lines;
tail-coverts, secondaries, and secondary-coverts black, slightly
glossed with blue; alula, primary-coverts, primaries, and rectrices
black, slightly glossed with dark green. Bill black; legs and nails
brown. Length, 190 to 195. A male from Cebu measures: Wing, 123; tail,
102; depth of fork, 55; bill from nostril, 6; tarsus, 14. A female
from Cebu, wing, 120; tail, 93; depth of fork, 46; bill from nostril,
6; tarsus, 14.

Young.--General color pattern as in the adult, but head and back less
strongly glossed with blue; chestnut on head and rump much lighter;
wings and tail dark brown instead of black, and inner secondaries
tipped with white; lower parts heavily washed with fawn, and
shaft-stripes shorter, browner, and less sharply defined, very faint
or altogether wanting on abdomen and under tail-coverts; axillars,
wing-lining, and flanks strongly washed with fawn, shaft-lines faint
or wanting.

If the Philippine representatives of the mosque swallow be included
with H. striolata, as they must be at present, this species has a
considerable range but it appears to be very local in occurrence. It
may be found in numbers in one part of an island and be altogether
absent a short distance away. It often appears in large flocks and may
disappear within a few hours. I found it nesting in Bohol Island in May
and in the Island of Batan during June. The nest is a bottle-shaped
structure of mud, plastered to a wall in a cave or to a beam beneath
a building. The eggs are pure white; three from Bohol measure: 22.6
by 14.7; 22.3 by 14.2; 22.8 by 14.7.



Family MUSCICAPIDÆ.


Edges of mandibles smooth with a small notch near the tip of the upper
one; bill moderately broad and flat; nostrils protected by a number
of long frontal bristles; frontal feathers more or less antrorse
(soft and pile-like in some genera), but not entirely concealing
the nostrils; rictal bristles long, numerous, and stiff; wings and
tail long, the latter extremely long in some species; first primary,
rarely minute, usually from one-half to two-thirds as long as wing;
tarsus and feet slender and weak, the former rather short. This family
contains a great number of closely related genera the species of which,
in many cases, are not easily determined except from adult males.

Typically the bill is broad and flat, but in certain genera it is
narrow and scarcely differs from the bill of some Turdine and Silvine
birds. The frontal nasal bristles, long rictal bristles, and the
weak legs and feet, are the most reliable family characters of this
group. In the typical flycatchers the skin is very thin and tender
which, taken in combination with their small necks and large heads,
makes their preparation as specimens very trying.

Some of the most beautiful birds found in the Philippine Islands belong
to this family, but several of the species are plainly colored. The
males in a few genera possess greatly lengthened tail-feathers;
in some others the head is crested.

    Hand-List (1906), 70.

    Palawan (Platen). Eastern Siberia, Altai Mountains, Japan; China
    in winter.


"Adult male.--General color above brown; least wing-coverts uniform
with the back, the greater series dark brown with lighter brown
tips to the median series, the greater coverts tipped with whitish;
primary-coverts and primaries dark brown, the secondaries edged with
pale brown, whitish at the tips; tail dark brown; lores buffy white;
in front of the eye a dusky spot; round the eye a ring of buffy
white feathers; feathers below the eye and ear-coverts brown like
the crown; cheeks white, mottled with brown bases to the feathers;
throat white, widening out on the lower part and separated from
the cheeks by a broad moustachial line of brown; breast and sides
of body ashy brown the former slightly mottled with grizzly white
edgings to the feathers; abdomen and under tail-coverts pure white;
thighs brown; under wing-coverts light tawny, with dusky bases to the
feathers, the quills ashy brown with an edging of light tawny to the
inner webs. 'Upper mandible dusky black; lower mandible yellowish
brown, tipped with dusky; legs and feet brownish black; iris dark
brown.' (Armstrong.) Length, 124; culmen, 10; wing, 80; tail, 56;
tarsus, 127.

"Observation.--The description is from a specimen collected by
Dr. Radde in Eastern Siberia on the 18th of May, 1856, and therefore
in full breeding plumage. Examples from other parts of China and
the Himalayas are similar, but great variation takes place in this
species as regards the tone and intensity of the brown color both
on the upper and under surface, and also in the uniform or mottled
color on the breast. The coloration of the throat is very different
in individuals, being in some almost uniform brown, succeeded by a
jugular spot of white.

"Young (Peking, Sept. 1868, R. Swinhoe).--Ashy brown, mottled with
whitish streaks and terminal spots to the feathers, the greater
coverts edged and tipped with buffy white, the rest of the coverts
spotted with whitish at the tips like the back; primary-coverts and
quills dark brown, the inner secondaries edged and tipped with pale
rufous; under surface very thickly mottled with brown, the feathers
being white with dusky brown edges." (Sharpe.)

The Siberian flycatcher must be considered a rare winter visitant to
the Philippine Islands.

Adult (sexes similar).--Above dusky brown; centers of feathers
and head darker; wings and tail blackish brown; secondaries and
wing-coverts fringed with white; below white; breast and sides of
throat and of abdomen marked with wide, dusky brown shaft-streaks;
middle of abdomen and under tail-coverts white; feathers of thighs
brown, tipped with white. A male from Benguet measures: Length,
133; wing, 86; tail, 51; culmen from base, 12; bill from nostril,
8. A female from Culion measures: Length, 127; wing, 80; tail, 45;
culmen from base, 11; bill from nostril, 7. The folded wing reaches
nearly or quite to the end of the tail.

In the gray-spotted flycatcher there is some variation in the brown
streaks of the under parts, but this species is not easily mistaken for
any other bird except Piprisoma æruginosum which has a very differently
shaped bill. The gray-spotted flycatcher is one of the commonest
winter visitants and is found in small numbers throughout the islands.

"Fairly common; often seen perched on some isolated tree in the open,
from which it flies now and then in pursuit of insects. Six males
average: Length, 132; wing, 83.5; tail, 50; culmen, 13; tarsus, 14;
middle toe with claw, 15. Four females, length, 128; wing, 81; tail,
49; culmen, 13; tarsus, 14; middle toe with claw, 15. Iris, legs, feet,
and nails almost black; bill black, except base of lower mandible,
which is yellowish or gray." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

"Adult.--General color above rufous-brown, shading into chestnut on
the rump and upper tail-coverts; head and nape sooty brown; least
wing-coverts like the back, the remainder of the coverts and the
secondaries blackish brown, edged and tipped with chestnut-rufous,
paler on the margins of the inner secondaries; primary-coverts and
primaries nearly uniform blackish brown, the first primary broadly
edged with rufous; two center tail-feathers dusky brown, the remainder
rufous, dusky brown along the outer web, the inner web more or less
dusky near the tip; round the eye a distinct ring of buffy white
feathers; lores rufous; feathers in front of and below the eye and the
ear-coverts dusky brown, mottled with whitish shaft-lines or spots;
under surface of body orange-rufous, the throat and sides of the
breast shaded with dusky brown; center of abdomen white; throat pale
rufous-buff, with dusky margins to most of the feathers; the bases of
the plumes of the lower throat white, forming a concealed white patch;
under wing-coverts deep orange-rufous; quills dark brown below, edged
with light rufous along the inner web. 'Bill black, with base of the
lower mandible whitish; feet dull gray, with the soles yellow and the
nails gray; iris brown.' (David.) Length, 114; culmen, 11; wing, 71;
tail, 51; tarsus, 13.

"Observation.--In some specimens the throat is pure white, with a malar
streak on each side of dusky black; the outer tail-feathers appear
gradually to lose all the dusky markings on the outer web." (Sharpe.)

The ferruginous flycatcher is a rare winter visitant to the Philippine
Islands. A specimen of doubtful sex taken in Mindoro by Doctor Mearns
measures: Wing, 69; tail, 48; culmen from base, 10; tarsus, 12.5. The
folded wings extend beyond the middle of the tail.



Genus ALSEONAX Cabanis, 1850.


The genus Alseonax is similar to Culicicapa and Hemichelidon, having
a very broad bill, but the rictal bristles are fewer and shorter than
in Culicicapa; the first primary is pointed and but little longer
than the primary-coverts. The sexes are alike in colors, being earthy
brown above and white below. The species are migratory.

"Coloration.--Upper plumage ashy brown, the feathers of the crown with
darker centers; tail dark brown, the outer feathers very narrowly
tipped with whitish; wings and coverts dark brown, all but the
primaries broadly edged with ashy white; lores and a ring of feathers
round the eye white; sides of head brown; lower plumage white, tinged
with ashy on the breast and sides of the body.

"The young have the crown blackish, streaked with fulvous; the upper
plumage and wings with large terminal fulvous spots; the lower plumage
like that of the adult but mottled with brown. After the autumn molt
and till the following spring the young are very rufous.

"Bill black, the base of the lower mandible yellow; mouth orange;
iris brown; legs and claws black. The young bird has the whole bill
yellow except the tip, which is dusky. Length rather more than 127;
tail, 51; wing, 71; tarsus, 13; bill from gape, 18." (Oates.)

"Young.--Differs from the adult in being flammulated above, the
feathers having large ovate spots of ochraceous buff in their centers,
the wing-coverts and quills being edged with rufous-buff; sides of
face light brown, streaked with buff; under surface of body white,
mottled with dusky brown edgings to the feathers; upper tail-coverts
and edges to the tail-feathers rufous.

"Observation.--Considerable variation takes place in this species,
but only as regards the color of the brown upper surface, which
differs in intensity, and as regards the brown on the chest;
this varies in extent, being sometimes broad, sometimes narrow,
and occasionally dissolved into obscure streaks. The edges to the
wing-coverts and quills are often rufescent, and this is probably a
sign of immaturity." (Sharpe.)

"Included in this list with a good deal of doubt. Sharpe includes the
Philippines in the range of this species, but whether he had any other
authority for so doing than the Marquis of Tweeddale's identification
of a single immature bird from Negros we do not know. We can find no
other record of its occurrence in the Philippines, and are inclined
to doubt its ever occurring there at all." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

398. CYORNIS HERIOTI Ramsay.

BLUE-BREASTED CYORNIS.


    Cyornis herioti Ramsay, Ibis (1886), 159 ([female]); Sharpe,
    Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1901), 11, 60; Hand-List (1901), 3, 215;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 71.
    Siphia enganensis Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1896), 5, 2; Ibis
    (1896), 112; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 111.

    Luzon (Heriot, Whitehead).


"Adult male.--Like the male of S. pallidipes, but the sides and
flanks are fawn-colored instead of pure white. Length, 152; culmen,
18; wing, 79; tail, 63; tarsus, 22.

"Adult female.--Even more different from the female of S. pallidipes:
the lores are rust-colored instead of white, and a short superciliary
band of the same color reaches as far as the eye, above this there
is a line of pale blue feathers, confluent across the forehead;
the basal part of the outer webs of the tail-feathers washed with
pale blue instead of reddish chestnut. Sides of the face dark brown,
shading gradually into the rust-colored throat, whereas in the female
of S. pallidipes the sides of the head are gray, and sharply defined
from the bright rust-colored throat. Length, 134; culmen, 16; wing,
74; tail, 55; tarsus, 18." (Grant.)

I have not seen the description of Cyornis herioti so have quoted
Grant's description of Siphia enganensis which is the same species. It
is evident that we have here a type differing from all the other
Philippine species of the genus. The male may be recognized by the
blue throat and breast. Heriot's flycatcher is either very rare,
or is confined to northern Luzon where it may prove to be abundant.



399. CYORNIS BANYUMAS (Horsfield).

JAVAN CYORNIS.

    Wiglesworth, Birds of Celebes (1898), 1, 368; pl. 14, fig. 1.

    Cyornis mindorensis Mearns, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A,
    356.

    Mindoro (Mearns, McGregor); Palawan (Everett). Java.


"Adult male.--General color above uniform blue, the forehead brighter
blue, extending backward over the eye; ear-coverts deep blue; a narrow
frontal line from the base of the nostrils, lores, feathers round the
eye, chin, and fore part of cheeks black; remainder of under surface
of body rich orange-rufous, a little paler and inclining to white on
the abdomen; sides of upper breast and thighs blue; wing-coverts blue
like the back, the least and median series brighter blue, of about the
same color as the forehead and eyebrow; quills dusky brown, externally
blue, the inner secondaries entirely blue; tail-feathers dark blue,
the outer ones black on the inner web; under wing-coverts and axillars
orange-rufous, the edge of the wing blue; quills dusky brown below,
lighter on the inner web. 'Bill black; legs pale brownish lead-color;
iris dark brown.' (Everett.) Length, 142; culmen, 14; wing, 81; tail,
72; tarsus, 16.5.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male but distinguished by the
white lores. 'Bill black; legs purplish leaden gray; iris
brown.' (Everett.) Wing, 70; tail, 60; tarsus, 16.

"Young.--Robin like. Dusky brown with subterminal spots of orange-buff
to all the feathers of the upper surface; wings and tail dusky,
externally blue, the secondaries tipped with buff like the coverts;
underneath orange-rufous, mottled with dusky margins to the feathers;
abdomen whitish." (Sharpe.)

"The existence of this species in Palawan rests upon a single skin
collected at Puerto Princesa, which is indistinguishable from the
male of S. banyumas as represented by a considerable series in the
British Museum." (Everett.)

In the Hand-List Sharpe restricts the distribution of the Javan cyornis
to Java, although in the Catalogue of Birds he places in the synonymy
of Siphia banyumas, the male collected in Palawan by Everett. Mearns
has recently described, under the name of Cyornis mindorensis, two
specimens which certainly seem to be distinct from C. philippinensis,
but they agree with the description of C. banyumas and with the plate
of that species in the Birds of Celebes. Mearns does not compare his
species with C. banyumas, and he could not have done so, as there
were no authentic specimens of C. banyumas at hand when he wrote his
description. Unfortunately such specimens are still lacking. A male
from Mariveles, Luzon and a female from Ticao Island differ from
ordinary C. philippinensis in having the crissum orange-buff, but
the color is not so deep as in the specimens from Mindoro. Cyornis
mindorensis may eventually prove to be a distinct species, but for
the present I shall consider it to be the same as C. banyumas.

tufts of white on the sides of the rump; lesser wing-coverts brighter
cobalt, forming a shoulder-patch; median and greater series blackish,
externally like the back; alula, primary-coverts, and quills black,
with narrow margins of dull blue, broader on the secondaries;
tail-feathers blackish, greenish blue externally; head like the back,
the base of the forehead brighter cobalt, extending backward over the
eye and forming an eyebrow; lores black; sides of face and ear-coverts
and cheeks black, glossed with dull blue; a moustachial line of blue
feathers tipped with white; a black chin spot; throat and fore neck
orange-buff, extending down the sides of the body, but paler and
inclining to whitish below the black chin-spot; center of breast and
abdomen white, as also the under tail-coverts, with a slight tinge
of buff; lateral breast-feathers tipped with blue, like the back;

white, slightly tinged with buff; edge of wing blue. Length, 150;
culmen, 18; wing, 74; tail, 63; tarsus, 18.

"This species is closely allied to Siphia philippinensis, but is
much larger, of a more greenish blue, and is especially distinguished
by the white moustache, forming a narrow line down each side of the
throat." (Sharpe.)

"Female.--Forehead, crown, and occiput dark plumbeous-gray, washed
with olive, each feather with narrow obsolete transverse bars,
which are most pronounced on the forehead; sides of neck, mantle,
scapulars, and back warm olivaceous-brown, deepening posteriorly into
bright ferruginous-brown on the upper tail-coverts; rectrices dark
sepia-brown, the exterior webs ferruginous-brown, except on the two
central quills, which are wholly ferruginous-brown, and all showing
in certain lights close obsolete transverse bars; under surface
of the quills hair-brown; primaries dark brown, and all except the
first and second margined basally on the outer webs by a thin line of
ferruginous-brown; the secondaries and tertials also dark brown, but
increasingly margined [with] bright ferruginous-brown until the entire
outer webs are of the latter color; under wing-coverts, axillars,
and edges of wing white, tinged with buff; major wing-coverts dark
brown, with bright ferruginous-brown outer webs; the other coverts
broadly tipped with bright ferruginous-brown; a conspicuous line from
the nares over the eye and reaching nearly to the posterior angle of
the orbit, and a line fringing the lower margin of the orbit, pure
white (tinged with buff in some examples); lores black; ear-coverts
dark gray, washed with olive; cheeks the same, but rather darker
gray; sides and flanks olive-gray, washed with buff; chin white;
throat pale buff, passing into deep orange-buff on the breast, on
the sides of which some of the plumes show obsolete dusky margins;
abdomen and lower tail-coverts white; thigh-plumes dark gray, edged
with white. Length, 147; culmen, 17; wing, 73; tail, 60; tarsus, 17.

"In another female from Balabac the dimensions are rather less, but
in my original Puerto Princesa specimen they agree very closely. This
species is marked by its large bill. The culmen in the type-skin
of the male, measured from its insertion in the skull, is 17 mm.,
and it is the same in a female collected by Mr. Whitehead at Taguso
in Palawan." (Everett.)

"Abundant in Palawan and the Calamianes islands. Habits like those of
S. philippinensis. Five males average: Length, 149; wing, 75; tail,
64; culmen, 18; tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw, 18. Three females,
length, 149; wing, 70; tail, 58; culmen, 17; tarsus, 16; middle toe
with claw, 17. Iris dark brown; legs and feet nearly black often
tinged with bluish; bill black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

The female of this species has been variously identified as Cyornis
banyumas, Siphia elegans, and Cyornis herioti. Everett was the first
ornithologist to describe it under the name Siphia lemprieri and his
description is here quoted.

18; middle toe with claw, 16.5. Iris brown; bill black; feet and
claws grayish flesh-color.

"Immature female.--Similar to adult females, but paler below, with
obscure spotting across the chest and on the sides." (Mearns.)

This species was discovered by Mearns on Mount Apo at 1,800 meters
altitude.



407. MUSCICAPULA BASILANICA (Sharpe).

BASILAN FLYCATCHER.


    Dendrobiastes basilanica Sharpe, Trans. Linn. Soc. 2d
    ser. Zool. (1877), 1, 332.
    Muscicapula basilanica Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 224; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 72.
    Muscicapula mindanensis Blasius, Jour. für Ornith. (1890), 147.

    Basilan (Steere, Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Mindanao (Platen,
    Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


Adult male.--Above, including sides of head and of neck, dark
slate-gray; upper tail-coverts nearly black; wings and tail dark
brown; secondaries and wing-coverts edged with slate-gray; a partly
concealed white patch or band on each side of nape; under parts white;
breast, sides, flanks, and thighs washed with slate-gray. A male
from Basilan measures: Wing, 69; tail, 43; culmen from base, 13.5;
bill from nostril, 9.5; tarsus, 21.

Adult female.--Above, including sides of head and of neck, rich
rusty brown, shading into bright chestnut on tail-coverts, tail,
and edges of secondaries; wings and tail dark brown; exposed edges
of primaries rusty brown; under parts white; breast, sides, flanks,
and thighs washed with rusty brown. A female from Basilan measures:
Wing, 66; tail, 43; culmen from base, 14; tarsus, 21.

The female of this species resembles very closely the female of
Rhinomyias ruficauda, but differs in having a shorter tail and
longer tarsus.

"We obtained a series of eight specimens from Basilan, and a single
bird from Mindanao. Not one of the Basilan birds shows a trace of
'yellowish white' on the tail-feathers; otherwise, they agree with
Blasius's description. As the Mindanao bird collected by us also lacks
all trace of any lighter color on the tail-feathers, we do not feel
like separating the birds from the two islands.

"The Basilan flycatcher is found on the ground in the forest and is
fairly common in Mindanao and Basilan. Eight males from the latter
island average: Length, 127; wing, 68; tail, 43; culmen, 16; tarsus,
21; middle toe with claw, 19. Iris black; anterior surface of legs and
upper surface of feet pale leaden; back surface of legs and bottoms
of feet white; bill black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



408. MUSCICAPULA SAMARENSIS Bourns and Worcester.

SAMAR FLYCATCHER.


    Muscicapula samarensis Bourns and Worcester, Minnesota
    Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers (1894), 1, 26; Grant and Whitehead,
    Ibis (1898), 237, pl. 6, fig. 6 (egg); Whitehead, Ibis (1899),
    105 (habits, plumage); Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 224; Oates
    and Reid, Cat. Birds' Eggs (1903), 3, 263; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 72.

    Leyte (Whitehead); Samar (Whitehead, Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult male.--Top of head, sides of face, ear-coverts, and hind neck
nearly black; back, rump, and upper wing-coverts uniform dark slaty
blue; quills and tail fulvous-brown, slightly washed with slaty blue;
chin and throat white; entire breast bluish gray, lightest on center
of breast; abdomen white; flanks washed with bluish gray; under
wing-coverts light buff, nearly white at base; sides dark slate-color
as are under wing-coverts and axillars, the latter, however, mottled
with white; a superciliary stripe of white beginning over eye and
extending to nape, then inward, nearly reaching the median line;
sexes alike. Iris very dark brown; bill black; legs, feet, and nails
very light brown. Measurements from four males: Length, 119; wing,
61; tail, 38; culmen, 15; tarsus, 20.

"The specimens described are in breeding plumage. They were shot
close to, or on, the ground in dense thickets in the deep woods.

"This species is closely allied to M. mindanensis Blasius, from
which it differs in its darker head, lighter tail, and much larger
superciliary stripe. None of our specimens shows a white bar on
the rump, but we find the Mindanao-Basilan birds variable in this
respect." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Female.--Upper parts rusty brown, darkest on the crown, and shading
into chestnut on the upper tail-coverts, the superciliary stripes
of the male only represented by a white feather or two on the sides
of the occiput; wings and tail dark brown, the exposed parts of the
quills mostly chestnut; sides of the head and neck light rusty brown,
palest round the eye, and forming a rather marked ring; under parts
much like those of the male, but the distinct gray pectoral zone
is replaced by one tinged with rusty; thighs brownish buff, under
tail-coverts buff. The type measures: Length, 109; culmen, 14; wing,
61; tail, 37; tarsus, 19. A second female measures: Length, 109;
culmen, 15; wing, 62; tail, 37; tarsus, 19.

"In general appearance the female of Muscicapula samarensis bears
a close resemblance to Rhynomyias ruficauda, the under parts being
strangely alike in both. The latter species is, however, easily
recognized by its much longer tail. 'Iris and bill black; tarsus
bluish white; feet white.--J. W.'

"The Samar white-browed flycatcher is described by Messrs. Bourns and
Worcester as having the sexes alike, but a mistake has evidently been
made in ascertaining the sex of the slate-colored bird described as
a female. Mr. Whitehead obtained two pairs of this species, and the
females differ entirely from the males in the color of the upper parts,
which are rusty brown, while the strongly marked white eyebrow-stripes
are practically absent. There can not be the slightest doubt that
the rufous-brown females are fully adult, for one was shot from a
nest with four eggs, and that they belong to the same species as the
slate-gray males is almost equally certain.

"I observe that the type of M. mindanensis Blasius, Jour. für
Orn. (1890), 147, a gray bird, is said to have been a female, but here
probably a mistake has been made. There are two adult gray examples
of this flycatcher from the Steere collection, both of which are
said to be males, and they agree perfectly with the description of
the type." (Grant.)

Whitehead secured two fresh eggs of the Samar white-browed flycatcher
near Paranas, Samar, on June 17, 1896. The eggs and nest are described
as follows:

"Shape ovate. Ground-color beautiful sea-green, speckled all over,
especially toward the larger end, with pale brown, the over-markings
being slightly darker and smaller. Measurements 19 mm. by 13 mm.

"The nest, a remarkably frail structure, was made of roots and lined
with broad leaves. It was well concealed, being placed close to the
ground in a heap of forest-drift near some rocks. The female bird
was snared." (Grant and Whitehead.)



Genus GERYGONE Gould, 1841.


Bill moderately depressed, depth at nostrils equal to about two-thirds
of its width, or two-fifths of bill from nostril; culmen with a
slight ridge; rictal and nasal bristles moderate; wing fairly long,
covering when folded about two-thirds of the tail; first primary
narrow, equal to one-half of second which is considerable shorter
than the subequal third, fifth, and sixth; fourth primary slightly
the longest; tarsus slender and equal to twice the length of exposed
culmen; tail slightly rounded and considerably shorter than wing. The
two Philippine species are very similar in colors; upper parts ashy
brown, lower part light yellow, lores whitish.

409. GERYGONE SIMPLEX Cabanis.

PHILIPPINE GERYGONE.


    Gerygone simplex Cabanis, Jour. für Orn. (1872), 316; Sharpe,
    Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1879), 4, 213; Hand-List (1901), 3, 226;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 72.

    Lubang (McGregor); Luzon (Jagor, Bourns & Worcester, McGregor);
    Mindoro (McGregor); Verde (McGregor).


Adult (sexes alike).--Above, including sides of head and neck,
ashy gray, with a very slight olivaceous tinge on back; lores and
a line over eye whitish; under parts clear straw-yellow, deepest
on chin and throat; under tail-coverts white, washed with yellow;
thighs slightly ashy; wings and tail brown with light edges to the
feathers; wing-coverts and upper tail-coverts like the crown; each
of the rectrices except the middle pair with a white spot on inner
web near tip and a preceding dusky band; edge and lining of wing
pale yellow. Iris dark brown; bill black; legs dark plumbeous. A
male from Laguna de Bay measures: Length, 122; wing, 51; tail, 36;
culmen from base, 12.

Young.--Lubang Island, October 25, 1902. A young bird just able to
fly, resembles the adult and differs only in having the under parts
very much paler yellow.

This little flycatcher closely resembles the species of Zosterops in
habits, but it is less common in occurrence. At times small flocks
are found feeding in clumps of bamboo or in high mangrove thickets. It
has a pleasing note by means of which the members of a flock are kept
together. In its active movements from tree to tree it resembles the
titmice, but we have never found Gerygone in forest. The type of the
species was collected in Luzon by Jagor.

"The Philippine gerygone was common about bamboo clumps in the open
fields of Luzon. Five males from Luzon average as follows: Wing,
51; tail, 38; culmen, 12; tarsus, 14; middle toe with claw, 12. Five
females, wing, 52; tail, 37; culmen, 12; tarsus, 16; middle toe with
claw, 16. Iris, legs, feet, and nails black; bill black." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)



410. GERYGONE RHIZOPHORÆ Mearns.

MANGROVE GERYGONE.

    Gerygone rhizophoræ Mearns, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. (1905), 18,
    7; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 72.

    Bongao (Everett); Mindanao (Mearns); Sulu (Guillemard, Bourns
    and Worcester).


"Adult male and female (seven specimens).--Upper parts, including
entire top and sides of head, ashy brown tinged with olive; upper
tail-coverts browner; sides of neck yellowish olive; tail-feathers
drab, subterminally and broadly banded with blackish, tipped with
drab-gray, and with a white spot near the end of the inner web of all
[each of] the tail-feathers except the innermost pair; wing-coverts
like the back; quills darker brown and narrowly edged with olive; whole
under parts straw-yellow except the crissum which is almost white;
lining and edge of wing yellowish white; thighs mixed straw-color
and olive-brown; inner edge of quills whitish. Measurements of male:
Wing, 50; tail, 39; culmen, 10.5; tarsus, 16." (Mearns.)

A female from Zamboanga is the only example of this species examined by
me. In this specimen the crown is slightly darker than in specimens of
G. simplex from Mindoro, Luzon, and Lubang with which I have compared
it. Unfortunately Mearns does not compare his species with G. simplex
which is probably its nearest relative. Guillemard records a gerygone
from Sulu as G. flaveola, and his specimens were, perhaps, the same
as G. rhizophoræ.



Genus ZANTHOPYGIA Blyth, 1847.


Bill at nostril slightly broader than deep, slightly compressed toward
the tip; rictal bristles moderate, extending half the length of bill;
tarsus twice the length of bill from nostril; wings moderate in
length, when folded extending nearly to tip of tail; first primary
much less than one-half the length of second, the latter less than
third and fourth which are subequal and longest; tail square and equal
to two-thirds of wing. Sexes very different in colors, the colors of
the male are yellow, black, and white.



411. ZANTHOPYGIA NARCISSINA (Temminck).

NARCISSUS FLYCATCHER.

    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 73.

    Calayan (McGregor); Mindanao (Steere). Japan, China; in winter
    to northern Borneo.


Male (Japan).--Above, including wings and tail, black; a line from
bill over eye to nape bright yellow; back and rump darker yellow;
upper tail-coverts black; some of the inner greater wing-coverts white,
forming a large patch; chin, throat, and breast bright orange-yellow,
becoming paler on lower breast and flanks, and gradually disappearing,
leaving the crissum pure white; sides of breast, edge of wing, and
thighs black; under wing-coverts and axillars white with slate-gray
bases. Wing, 78; tail, 53; culmen from base, 13; bill from nostril,
7; tarsus, 15.

Female (Calayan Island).--Above olive-brown, more greenish on rump;
upper tail-coverts and tail dull rufescent brown; wings brown,
the primaries narrowly, the secondaries and coverts more widely,
edged with dirty white or pale rufous-brown; lores, a line over
eye, and eye-circle pale yellowish white; lower parts whitish,
washed, more or less, with pale yellow which is brighter on throat;
breast more or less mottled with dusky brown. Upper mandible black;
lower mandible horn-blue; iris dark reddish brown; legs pale blue;
nails gray. Length, 127; wing, 73; tail, 47; culmen from base, 13;
bill from nostril, 7; tarsus, 16.

"The single male specimen obtained by Steere at Dumalon, Mindanao,
in 1874, is still preserved in the Museum of the University of
Michigan. No others seem to have been obtained since." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

In Calayan on October 30, 1903, McGregor and Celestino took a female
flycatcher which is undoubtedly a specimen of this migratory species,
but it was not recorded in the report on the Calayan collection. In
the field the female might be mistaken for the willow warbler or
for one of the little plain-colored flycatchers, but the male would
scarcely be overlooked if it were at all abundant. The species must,
therefore, be considered a rare winter visitant to the Philippines.



Genus CYANOPTILA Blyth, 1847.


The genus Cyanoptila is not easily distinguished from Zanthopygia. In
the former genus the colors of the male are blue, black, and white;
the wing formula is the same as that of Zanthopygia; tail equal to
nearly three-fourths of wing; tarsus one and one-half times the length
of bill from nostril.



412. CYANOPTILA BELLA (Hay).

JAPANESE BLUE FLYCATCHER.

    Cyanoptila cyanomelæna Everett, Ibis (1895), 24.

    Balabac (Everett); Palawan? [58] Japan, China, Indo-Chinese
    countries, northwestern Borneo.


"Adult male.--General color above blue, the greater coverts uniform
with the back, the lesser and median coverts brighter and more
cobalt-blue, forming a shoulder patch; head still brighter and more
lazuline blue, richest on the forehead; a narrow frontal line, lores,
eyelid, sides of face, and entire throat and chest black; rest of
under surface of body pure white, the flanks ashy; thighs black; under
wing-coverts dusky brown, broadly edged with blue; the edge of the
wing bright blue; primary-coverts and quills dusky brown, externally
greenish blue; middle tail-feathers dark blue, the remainder blue on
the outer web, black on the inner, with conspicuous white bases to
the feathers. 'Bill black; legs brown; iris black.' (David.) Length,
140; culmen, 14; wing, 86; tail, 61; tarsus, 15.

"Observation.--A male bird from Japan, in the Leiden Museum, marked
Cyanoptila cyanothorax, is a little different from the full-plumaged
male, being of a greener cobalt above, and has the throat washed with
greenish blue. The blue color on the head is different being brighter
cobalt. Specimens from Borneo do not differ from the Japanese bird
described in any important particulars; one has a gloss of blue on the
throat and chest, another is more greenish blue above, while a Tingchow
male has the back greenish blue, with distinct black shaft-streaks.

"Adult female.--Different from the male. Ashy brown, above, washed
with pale verditer-blue on the scapulars, lower back, and upper
tail-coverts; least wing-coverts bright blue as in adult male, the
rest and the quills externally verditer-blue, the outermost of the
greater series dull brown, edged with ashy brown and narrowly tipped
with whitish; tail as in male, but rather more greenish blue; lores and
anterior part of cheeks rufescent buff; ear-coverts ashy brown, with
whitish shaft-lines; throat, abdomen, and under tail-coverts white;
fore-neck, chest, and sides of body ashy brown; under wing-coverts
and axillars ashy brown, the edge of the wing blue. 'Bill blackish
brown, legs grayish brown, iris dark brown.' (Swinhoe.)  Wing, 89;
tail, 61; tarsus, 15.

"Young male.--Similar to old female, but having the back greenish
blue, only the head and neck ashy brown, even the crown being slightly
shaded with blue; upper tail-coverts with white edgings; wings and
tail as in adult, the outer greater coverts tipped with buff; below
as in female, but having the throat ochraceous, the breast washed
with ocher, as also the sides of the body." (Sharpe.)

The Japanese blue flycatcher is a rare winter visitant to the
Philippine Islands.



Genus HYPOTHYMIS Boie, 1826.


Bill flattened and depressed for its entire length, the outline
not curved inward toward the tip; depth of bill at nostril nearly
two-thirds of the width; bill from nostril more than one-half the
tarsus; rictal bristles conspicuous, the longest equal to bill
from nostril; wings short, about equal to tail; first primary
equal to one-half of third; fourth, fifth, and sixth subequal and
longest; seventh greater than third; second primary shorter than
the secondaries; tail slightly graduated, outermost feathers shorter
than middle pair by about one-third the length of tarsus; feathers
of head short and soft, occipital crest short; dominative color blue,
abdomen white.

Male.--General color azure-blue, brighter on head, darker on back
and rump and slightly purplish on breast; a narrow line on forehead,
another on chin, and a round or oval patch on back of head, velvety
black; a narrow crescent of black across breast; abdomen, flanks,
and under tail-coverts white; thighs washed with blue; wings and tail
black, the edges of the feathers washed with dark blue. Iris dark;
bill blue, edged and tipped with black; eyelids and feet blue, nails
black; inside of mouth pale greenish yellow. Length, about 160; wing,
65; tail, 65; culmen from base, 13; bill from nostril, 10; tarsus, 15.

Female.--Differs from the male in having the back, rump, wings,
and tail brown, in lacking the nuchal patch and breast crescent, and
in having the blue of head and throat somewhat duller and the breast
bluish gray. Length, about 150; wing, 67; tail, 65; bill from nostril,
9; tarsus, 15.

"We gathered a large series of specimens of this common bird with
the purpose of determining whether more than one species occurred in
the Philippines. It is our decided opinion, after carefully examining
a large series of specimens from all parts of the Archipelago, that
there is no ground whatever for attempting to separate the birds from
different islands. There is a great deal of individual variation
in color, but all the various phases may be found in the birds of
any one locality, the coloring changing greatly with the season,
as well as with age, and frequently a good deal of variation occurs
even among fully adult birds shot at a given time.

"If it be granted that we are dealing with but a single species,
and we fail to see how anyone can doubt it who will look over a good
series of specimens, it only remains to decide what name belongs to
it. Sharpe states, Catalogue of Birds (1879), 4, 276, that as the white
belly is the character by which the two species are distinguished,
and as this is shown clearly in Daubenton's plate of H. azurea,
he has adopted that title for the Indian bird, in spite of the fact
that the plate is professedly founded on the 'Goubemouches bleu des
Philippines.' In other words, since the bird figured shows a white
belly, Doctor Sharpe thinks it must have come from India and not from
the Philippines. Now, while in some of our Philippine birds the belly
is washed with blue, and in two specimens is decidedly bluish, in the
majority of the specimens it is pure white. We are in no position to
go into the question as to whether the Indian and Philippine birds
are really distinct, not having the necessary material from India for
comparison, but there is most certainly no reason for thinking that
the subject of Daubenton's plate did not come from the Philippines
because it has a white belly. We therefore retain his title for the
Philippine bird. It is one of the commonest birds in the islands.

"Ten males average: Length, 156; wing, 69; tail, 71; culmen, 15;
tarsus, 15; middle toe with claw, 14. Five females, length, 147; wing,
67; tail, 67; culmen, 14; tarsus, 15; middle toe with claw, 14. Bill
blue in male, but often black in female; legs and feet bluish, nails
black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

A nest of the black-naped flycatcher, containing three eggs, was found
in Mindoro in April, it was composed of green moss and soft bits of
dry bamboo leaves, and lined with fine blackish fibers. The outside
was decorated with cotton-like substance from one of the fulgorid
insects. The eggs were white, marked with dots of reddish brown.

A nest and two eggs found by Whitehead near Cape Engaño, Luzon,
on May 24, 1895, are described as follows:

"Shape rounded ovate. Ground-color pure white, thickly speckled,
especially round the larger end, with small spots and dots of
brown-lake and with a few pale lilac under-markings. In general
character these eggs resemble those of the tits (Paridæ). Measurements
17 mm. by 14 mm.

"Nest cup-shaped, generally placed in a forked branch among the
lower growth in old forests. The structure is made of moss firmly
bound together with white spider's-web and lined with fine brown
fibers." (Grant and Whitehead.)

The black-naped flycatcher is one of the commonest of Philippine
birds and is found wherever there are thickets or forest. It is more
or less solitary in habits.



Genus CAMIGUINIA McGregor, 1907.


Bill moderately flattened as in Cyanomyias; culmen less than tarsus and
equal to middle toe with claw; rictal bristles longer than bill from
nostril; first primary little more than one-half of second, the latter
much less than third; fifth longest and slightly longer than fourth
and sixth; tail about equal to wing and slightly graduated; feathers
of chin, lores, and forehead short, soft, and pile-like; feathers of
crown more or less scale-like; occipital crest soft and full.

This genus is intermediate between Cyanomyias and Hypothymis; from
the former it differs in lacking the greatly lengthened crest and the
antrorse loral plumes, and from the latter it differs in having the
feathers of crown and crest scale-like, instead of soft and velvety.

Adult male.--General color light azure-blue; rump and upper
tail-coverts lighter; breast darker; frontal line, chin, lores,
and a narrow circumocular line velvety black, forming a mask which
is narrowly bordered behind with bright silvery cobalt-blue, widest
behind forehead and chin; middle of lower breast, abdomen, under
tail-coverts, wing-lining, and axillars white; wings and tail black,
the exposed edges of feathers dark azure-blue, except first and second
primaries; two outermost pairs of rectrices narrowly tipped with
white in old birds only. Iris brown; the narrow eyelids light blue;
bill blue, except edges and tip which are black; legs and feet blue;
nails blackish. Length, 154; wing, 67.5; tail, 67; culmen from base,
15; bill from nostril, 9; tarsus, 16. In the slightly immature, but
fully feathered, male the crest is less developed, the feathers of
the crown are less scale-like, and the upper parts are darker blue
than in the fully adult male.

Adult female.--General color dull verditer-blue; head, neck, and
sides of head brighter; forehead dull cobalt; chin whitish, bordered
by dull cobalt; throat, breast, and sides grayish, washed with dull
azure-blue, shafts white; abdomen, flanks, under tail-coverts, and
middle of lower breast white; wings and tail blackish brown, edged
with dull verditer-blue. Wing, 64; tail, 64; culmen from base, 14;
bill from nostril, 9; tarsus, 17.

Young in first plumage.--Above smoky gray; below white; a dusky
band across fore breast; wings and tail blackish brown; primaries
and secondaries edged with verditer; outer webs of rectrices washed
with verditer.

"Rare in Samar. Always found in company with other flycatchers. Four
males average: Length, 137; wing, 63; tail, 62; culmen, 13; tarsus,
14; middle toe with claw, 13. A female, length, 130; wing, 59; tail,
55; culmen, 13; tarsus, 14; middle toe with claw, 13. Iris nearly
black; legs and feet slaty blue; nails usually black, in one case
bluish slate; bill blue, with black tip; eye-wattles blue. Breeding
in August." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

The specimens from Camiguin Island, north of Luzon, on which was based
Camiguinia personata, are slightly larger than specimens from Mindanao
and the latter are probably Cyanomyias helenæ of Steere. There appears
to be no ground for retaining C. personata.



Genus CYANOMYIAS Sharpe, 1879.


Bill slightly compressed near tip, depth at nostril two-thirds
of width, outline sightly concave toward the tip; rictal bristles
conspicuous, the longest more than bill from nostril; wing and tail
about equal, wing formula as in Hypothymis; tarsus one and one-half
times the bill from nostril; feathers of head stiffish, decomposed
basally and conspicuously antrorse on lores; feathers of occipital
crest long and narrow.



415. CYANOMYIAS COELESTIS (Tweeddale).

CELESTIAL BLUE FLYCATCHER.


    Hypothymis coelestis Tweeddale, Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. (1877), IV,
    20, 536; Proc. Zool. Soc. (1878), 109, pl. 7, fig. 1 ([female]).
    Cyanomyias coelestis Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1879), 4,
    278; Hand-List (1901), 3, 249; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 73.

    Basilan (Steere Exp., McGregor); Dinagat (Everett); Luzon
    (McGregor); Mindanao (Bourns & Worcester, Celestino); Sibuyan
    (Bourns & Worcester).


Male.--General color blue; forehead, lores, and entire head
and face clear cerulean blue contrasting strongly with the light
cobalt-blue of back, wings, and tail; chin, throat, and fore breast
deep azure-blue, becoming gradually fainter and more greenish on
lower breast; abdomen, flanks, and under tail-coverts white, washed
more or less with turquoise-blue; thighs blue; rectrices black below
and their inner webs black above; primaries and secondaries black,
edged with blue. Iris white; eyelids light greenish yellow; bill
dark blue like throat with black tip and edges; legs very dark blue;
nails black. Length of a male from Basilan, 165; wing, 75; tail, 76;
culmen from base, 14; bill from nostril, 9; tarsus, 16; crest, 36.

Female.--Differs from the male in having a much shorter crest and
less intense colors; top of head darker, of nearly the same shade as
back and wings; throat and breast cobalt instead of azure. Wing, 73;
tail, 70; bill from nostril, 15; tarsus, 16; crest, 17.

This magnificent flycatcher is very rare; it is found in small numbers,
feeding and moving about in the tops of forest trees, associated with
species of such genera as Hypothymis, Rhipidura, and Pardaliparus.

"A very rare bird. Found only by accident, and always with other
flycatchers. Four males average: Length, 159; wing, 72; tail, 74;
culmen, 16; tarsus, 16; middle toe with claw, 15. Two females,
length, 154; wing, 73; tail, 74; culmen, 16; tarsus, 17; middle toe
with claw, 16. Iris dark brown; legs and feet slaty blue, nails black;
bill black at tip and along gape, elsewhere blue; eye-wattles greenish
yellow." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus RHIPIDURA Vigors and Horsfield, 1826.


Rictal bristles long and conspicuous, equal to culmen from base
or longer; bill wide, depressed for most of its length, slightly
compressed near tip; wing shorter than tail; first primary more than
one-half of second and less than one-half of third; fourth, fifth,
and sixth nearly equal, fifth longest; tail-feathers graduated,
the difference between outermost and middle rectrices equal to or
greater than culmen; plumage soft, that of head neither scale-like
nor pile-like; colors various.

I can see no good reason why Hypothymis superciliaris Sharpe and
H. samarensis Steere should not be placed in the genus Rhipidura;
their long graduated tail-feathers, long stiff oral bristles, and lax
plumage, as well as the similarity in the coloration of the sexes,
certainly unite them with the members of Rhipidura. [59]

"A very showy bird. Common in the forests of the islands where it
occurs. Like R. cyaniceps, it makes the most of itself. It is bold
and easily killed. It is particularly abundant in Negros. Five males
average 176 in length; wing, 79; tail, 88; culmen, 16; tarsus, 17;

    U-li-li-su, Benguet, Luzon.

    Luzon (Meyer, Everett, Whitehead, Steere Exp., McGregor).


Adult (sexes alike).--Very similar to R. albiventris, but abdomen,
flanks, and thighs cinnamon-rufous. A male measures: Wing, 75; tail,
86; culmen from base, 12; bill from nostril, 8; tarsus, 18. A female,
wing, 74; tail, 81; culmen from base, 12; tarsus, 17.

Whitehead collected a nest and two eggs of this species at Cape Engaño,
Luzon, April 29, 1895, which are described as follows:

"Shape ovate. Ground-color rich cream-color. A zone of spots and small
blotches round the larger end; the under-markings pale slate-gray,
the over-markings darker cream-color. Measurements 19 mm. by 14 mm.

"Nest of the usual cup-shaped type made by all the species of
Rhipidura, and placed on a dead bough in an open pathway in a
conspicuous position." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"Sharpe mentions a specimen of R. cyaniceps in the British Museum
collected in Mindanao by Cuming. It seems to us extremely unlikely
that such a bird could have been overlooked by the numerous collectors
who have since visited that island, and we do not believe it exists
there. Cuming does not seem to have been over particular about
recording exact localities in the case of his Philippine collections,
and it is not at all improbable that this record is an error." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)



420. RHIPIDURA SAULI Bourns and Worcester.

SAUL'S FANTAIL.

    Minn. Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers (1894), 1, 6; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 74.

    Tablas (Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


"Adult male.--Head, crown, and nape dull bluish gray, each of the
feathers of crown with a narrow, decidedly lighter, shaft-mark,
lacking in feathers of nape and mantle; back, rump, upper tail-coverts,
scapulars, and upper wing-coverts chestnut; wing black; tertiaries
and secondaries heavily edged with chestnut; primaries lightly
edged with same color; central pair of tail-feathers black, faintly
edged with chestnut on basal half and with shafts black; next pair
with inner webs black, outer webs chestnut, shafts black on inner
side, chestnut on outer; rest of feathers of tail including shafts
chestnut above and below; sides of face, ear-coverts, chin, throat,
and upper breast bluish gray like the mantle; feathers of breast with
distinct lighter shaft-markings; feathers of lower breast gradually
changing to the chestnut of abdomen; flanks, under tail-coverts,
and thighs chestnut; axillars and under wing-coverts bluish gray at
base, heavily tipped with chestnut; inner webs of quills tipped with
chestnut. Female like male but paler. Iris dark brown; legs and feet
vary from light to very dark slaty brown; nails blackish; bill black,
except base of lower mandible which is gray.

"Twelve males average 184 in length; wing, 84; tail, 91; culmen, 16;
tarsus, 18. Three females, length, 174; wing, 76; tail, 83; culmen,
16; tarsus, 19.

"This is another ornithological puzzle of the Tablas-Romblon-Sibuyan
group. It seems to be confined to Tablas where it is common in deep
forests. It differs from R. cyaniceps, its nearest ally, in its larger
size and darker blue head and in having the ochraceous buff of under
parts replaced by deep chestnut." (Bourns and Worcester.)

upper tail-coverts chestnut, but primaries and primary-coverts blackish
brown, edged with chestnut. Wing, 74; tail, 85; culmen from base, 15;
bill from nostril, 8; tarsus, 17. "Iris reddish brown; bill all black;
feet dark purplish gray; claws black. Length, 177." (Mearns.)

I have not seen the female of the black and cinnamon fantail but the
sexes are probably similar in colors. This fine species is found on
Mount Apo.



422. RHIPIDURA HUTCHINSONI Mearns.

    Mindanao (Mearns).


Adult.--Similar to R. nigrocinnamomea, but with no white on the
breast which is uniform cinnamon-rufous; the white lines over eyes
are connected across the forehead by a wide white band.

"Iris dark brown; bill black; feet plumbeous, with claws nearly
black. Skin measurements of the type (adult male) are as follows:
Length, 155; wing, 78; tail, 95; culmen, 11.7; tarsus, 19.5. Skin
measurements of adult female: Length, 153; wing, 73; tail, 84; culmen,

Adult (sexes similar).--Above ashy gray; forehead, crown, and sides
of face black; a wide white band over each eye, for the most part
concealed; below white with a wide white pectoral band; abdomen
and crissum washed with pale buff; feathers of thighs black, tipped
with pale buff; axillars and wing-lining blackish brown edged with
white; rectrices blackish brown, all but middle pair with wide white
tips. Iris dark brown; bill, legs, and nails black.

"Common throughout the islands. A very showy bird, constantly opening
and closing its tail, and dancing about to show its feathers. Three
male birds average 190 in length; wing, 87; tail, 110; culmen, 17;
tarsus, 21; middle toe with claw, 18. Four females, length, 190;
wing, 81; tail, 99; culmen, 17; tarsus, 20; middle toe with claw,

Two eggs collected by Steere in Marinduque, May 8, 1888, are described
as follows:

"Shape ovate. Ground-color pale creamy white, with a rather wide
zone round the middle composed of small blotches and spots of pale
yellowish brown or lavender-gray; a few scattered spots of the
same colors over the rest of the shell. Measurements 18 mm. by 14
mm." (Grant and Whitehead.)

A set of three eggs, also collected in Marinduque by Steere, are said
to be similar to the above but with the markings rather smaller. The
measurements are 19 by 15.

"The two nests are of the usual cup-shaped type, constructed of tightly
woven fiber and wide dead grass bound together with spiders' webs, and
neatly lined with fine grasses and black fiber." (Grant and Whitehead.)

    (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Samar (Whitehead); Sibuyan (Bourns
    & Worcester, McGregor); Tablas (Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


Adult male.--Entire plumage rich chestnut-rufous with inner webs
of primaries and secondaries seal-brown near their tips. Iris,
eyelids, and bill blue; bill edged and tipped with black; legs and
nails lighter blue. Wing, 87; tail, excepting central rectrices, 85;
central rectrices, 100 to 190; culmen from base, 20; bill from nostril,
13; tarsus, 16.

Adult female and immature.--Lighter in color and with lower breast,
abdomen, and tail-coverts whitish; central rectrices not greatly
lengthened.

"In Jour. für Orn. (1891), 294, Hartert very properly calls attention
to the fact that confusion evidently exists as to the distribution of
the two rufous species of Zeocephus, and he even seems to question the
distinctness of the two species. We have some suggestions to offer,
after looking over our series of thirty-one specimens from Luzon,
Mindoro, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi Tawi. First,
the young immature birds of Z. rufus have the white belly and general
coloring of Z. cinnamomeus. They are not to be distinguished from birds
of the latter species. Second, out of fifteen specimens from the south,
seven do not show a trace of white on the belly, and are of a uniform
deep rufous color. Third, we have a male bird in breeding plumage
from Cebu which is indistinguishable, so far as shade of rufous is
concerned, from Basilan birds. The confusion between the two species
is thus readily understood. Are they then distinct? We think that
they are for the following reasons: The average fully adult bird from
the northern islands is very much darker in color than the darkest
of the southern birds. The northern birds have the tail much more
strongly graduated than that of the birds from the south. None of our
specimens from the south show any special elongation of the central
tail-feathers. In one specimen from Tablas and another from Sibuyan the
central tail-feathers exceed the rest by fully 75 millimeters. Other
birds collected at the same time and place do not show nearly so
strong a development of these feathers, but the fact remains that
nothing even approaching it is shown by our specimens from the south.

"The dark tips of the tail-feathers described by Dr. Sharpe as
characteristic of Z. cinnamomeus are simply a sign of immaturity,
as is the white of the belly.

"Zeocephus rufus, then, inhabits the northern and central Philippines,
and is to be distinguished from Z. cinnamomeus by its darker color
when fully adult, and by its more strongly graduated tail, which has
the central feathers at least 75 millimeters longer than the others
when the birds are in perfect plumage.

"Four males from Cebu average: Length, 223; wing, 93; tail, 116;
culmen, 23; tarsus, 21; middle toe with claw, 18. Five females,
length, 201; wing, 86; tail, 106; culmen, 23; tarsus, 21; middle
toe with claw, 18. A male from Sibuyan with elongated tail-feathers
measures 283 in length; wing, 94; tail, 162; culmen, 24; tarsus,
17; middle toe with claw, 19. Iris almost black; legs and feet blue;
nails black, sometimes showing a little blue; bill and eye-wattles
bright blue. Breeding in Cebu in June." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

A set of three eggs was collected by Whitehead at Cape Engaño, Luzon,
on April 24, 1895. The eggs and nest are described as follows:

"Shape ovate. Ground-color pure white, with a decided zone of small
blotches and spots round the pole of the larger end; upper-markings
brown-lake, and under-markings lilac. Two of the eggs have small
dots of the darker color thinly scattered over the whole shell,
while in the third these markings are almost entirely confined to

"Nest much like that built by Hypothymis azurea, and placed in similar
positions, but within the brown lining is a second lining of fine black
fiber taken from the base of the palm-leaves." (Grant and Whitehead.)

Genus CALLAEOPS Grant, 1895.


"A new genus of Muscicapidæ most nearly allied to Arses, which it
resembles in having a disk-like wattle formed by the prolongation
of the eyelid, which entirely surrounds the rather large eye. As in
Terpsiphone, there is a large, full, occipital crest, and the tarsi and
toes are short and slender; but the tail is like that of Rhipidura,
wedge-shaped and composed of twelve feathers, the outer pair being
two-thirds of the length of the middle pair. The first flight-feather
is half the length of the second, which is about equal to the tenth;
the fourth being slightly the longest." (Grant.)

"Adult male.--General color deep black with a slight purplish gloss,
especially on the back and breast; the middle of lower breast and belly
white, the under tail-coverts being edged with the same color. Wattle
surrounding the eye, bill, and feet said to be pale blue. Length,
216; wing, 89; tail, 114; tarsus, 15. The only specimen sent home by
Whitehead was not of his own collecting, but purchased in Manila and,
as I understand, said to have been obtained in that vicinity. The
color of the soft parts and sex are, I fancy, only given on the
authority of the collector from whom the bird was obtained." (Grant.)



Genus TERPSIPHONE Gloger, 1827.


Bill large and depressed; rictal bristles numerous, coarse, and long;
head with a full occipital crest; eye surrounded by a wide fleshy
wattle; rectrices graduated. The sexes are similar in plumage during
the first two years and the birds breed in this immature condition. In
the third year the male develops a distinctive plumage and his central
rectrices grow to twice the length of the second pair.

    Ti-uay-uay, Batan.

    Batan (McGregor).


Adult male (type).--Black, with a slight purplish blue gloss; middle
of abdomen white; under tail-coverts black with white bases and
with traces of clay-brown along the edges; wings and tail black with
some purplish blue gloss on exposed margins. Iris brown; bill, legs,

Nearly adult male.--Similar to the adult, but some feathers of
lower back and a few of the inner remiges edged with chestnut;
middle of lower breast, axillars, and wing-lining mottled with white;
abdomen white; under tail-coverts terra-cotta yellow with small dusky
patches. Length, 376; wing, 90; tail-feathers: longest, 267; second,
127; shortest, 80; culmen from base, 19; bill from nostril, 13;
tarsus, 16.5; middle toe with claw, 16.5; longest crest-feathers, 16.

Male, first year.--Head, neck, throat, and breast glossy black;
mantle, back, and rump bright chestnut; upper tail-coverts chestnut
and glossy black (mixed plumage); lower breast gray; abdomen white;
flanks dull chestnut; under tail-coverts white washed with terra
cotta; alula, primaries and primary-coverts blackish brown; primaries
and secondary-coverts edged with chestnut; secondaries edged with
rusty brown; rectrices dark brown, slightly chestnut, the outer
pair minutely tipped with white. Length, 190; wing, 85; tail, 85;
outermost rectrices, 71; culmen from base, 18.5; bill from nostril, 13.

Adult female.--Differs from the adult male, first year, in having
mantle, back, tail-coverts, and secondary-coverts reddish brown instead
of chestnut. Length, 190; wing, 85; tail, 81; outermost rectrices,
74; culmen from base, 20; bill from nostril, 13. Another female is
duller, having the mantle, back, and rump decidedly grayer. Length,
189; wing, 85; tail, 88; culmen from base, 17; bill from nostril, 12.

First plumage.--Above dull brown; top of head, back, and tail dull
reddish brown; post ocular band dull ocherous; chin, throat, and breast
gray, the latter crossed by an ocherous band; lower breast, abdomen,
and under tail-coverts white, slightly washed with ocherous; wings
blackish, primaries edged with dull reddish brown; primary-coverts
blackish; secondaries and their coverts edged with dull rusty ocherous
taking the form of terminal spots on median coverts. Bill dull brown;
legs pale blue; nails white.

Apparently this species breeds in its second year but does not reach
its most perfect plumage until its fourth year.

A nest taken in Batan Island, May 29, 1907, was saddled securely in
the fork of a small branch. The single egg was heavily incubated and
measured 15.4 by 20.3. The egg was dull white, sparsely spotted with
dark umber-brown.

The black paradise flycatcher is abundant in Batan. Its flight is
easy and graceful but rather slow. The call is harsh and cat-like;
the song is simple and of limited range, consisting of several clear
notes uttered in rapid succession.

The short-tailed black males of this flycatcher agree with the
description of Callaeops periopthalmica, but the identity of the two
species has not been established.



Genus RHINOMYIAS Sharpe, 1879.

    Oates and Reid, Cat. Birds' Eggs (1903), 3, 282; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 75.

    Guimaras (Bourns & Worcester); Negros (Bourns & Worcester,
    Whitehead.)


"Adult male.--General color above ochraceous brown, duller on head,
much brighter on rump, becoming chestnut on the tips of upper
tail-coverts; upper wing-coverts like back; quills nearly black,
washed with rusty brown on outer webs, this wash changing to whitish
on the primaries; upper surface of tail dull chestnut, the feathers
becoming almost black at tips; lores gray; ear-coverts and sides of
hind neck like crown; a ring of feathers round eye slightly lighter;
chin and entire throat white; entire breast light olive-brown; flanks
washed with same color; abdomen pure white; under tail-coverts white,
light brown at tips; under wing-coverts, axillars, and inner webs of
quills buffy white; bend of wing olive-brown.

"The white throat contrasts strongly with the brown of neck and breast
and at once distinguishes this species from all other Philippine
representatives of the genus. R. albigularis is a deep woods form
and is extremely rare in the localities visited by us." (Bourns
and Worcester.)

"One of the most interesting birds sent from Negros is this
white-throated flycatcher, very nearly allied to R. pectoralis, which
inhabits the south of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. The
present species may, of course, be distinguished by its considerably
larger size and the absence of the white patch in front of the eye,
as well as by the more olivaceous brown cheeks and chest-band, which
are not so strongly contrasted with the white of the throat. But these
differences are really slight, and it seems very curious that the
Negros and Guimaras birds should so closely resemble R. pectoralis
from Borneo, while we find two distinct but closely allied species,
R. ruficauda and R. ocularis, occurring in the intermediate
islands. In Prof. Steere's collection we have received the types of
R. samarensis as well as two specimens collected at Ayala, Mindanao,
which he considers to represent an undescribed species. They apparently
differ from his R. samarensis only in having the culmen reddish brown
instead of blackish brown; but this difference is due to immaturity,
as is further proved by the subterminal buff spots on the innermost
secondaries, which are undoubtedly remains of the first plumage. Again,
Prof. Steere distinguishes his R. samarensis from R. ruficauda Sharpe,
of which we have several examples. He says that the former differs 'in
having the cheeks brown, not olive, and in having the under surface
washed with fulvous brown, this forming a white band across the
chest.' In comparing the type of R. samarensis with typical examples
of R. ruficauda from Basilan, we fail to find any difference in the
color of the cheeks, and the somewhat indistinct band across the chest,
which can hardly be described as 'broad,' is equally well developed in
a male from Basilan. There can be no doubt that the birds from Samar
(R. samarensis Steere), Mindanao, and Basilan (R. ruficauda Sharpe)
belong to one species and must stand as R. ruficauda Sharpe." (Grant.)

Whitehead collected a nest and two eggs of this species in Negros on
March 31, 1906. They are described as follows:

"Shape [of eggs] short ovate, one much blunter at the small end
than the other. Ground-color very pale dull rufous, indistinctly
mottled all over with darker shades of the same color. In general
appearance these eggs strongly resemble one type laid by the common
robin. Measurements 23 mm. by 17 mm.

"The nest, composed of moss and lined with fine roots, was placed
in a hole in an old rotten tree about six feet [two meters] from the
ground. The eggs were partially incubated, and the female was snared
on the nest." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"Adult female.--General color above, including the wings and tail,
dark slate, shading into dull black on top of head and ear-coverts;
a narrow white band across the base of bill, continued over lores
in a narrow superciliary stripe; lores and feathers surrounding
the upper eyelid black; chin, throat, middle of breast, belly, and

"Adult male and female.--The sexes of this extremely handsome
flycatcher are perfectly similar to one another in plumage, and
most nearly resemble R. gularis Sharpe, from Kina Balu, though the
differences are remarkably striking. Upper parts olive, washed with
sienna on the rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail; the superciliary
stripes, chin, and throat-patch, middle of lower breast and belly,
and under tail-coverts pure white; lores and fore part of the cheeks
blackish; rest of cheeks, ear-coverts, and sides of throat olive washed
with rufous, the latter color gradually increasing in intensity on

Negros and Guimaras and R. ocularis from Sulu and Tawi Tawi, described
by Bourns and Worcester, Occ. Papers Minnesota Acad. (1894), 1, 27,
28. It resembles both these species in having the middle of the throat,
belly, and under tail-coverts white, but may be at once distinguished
by the strongly marked white superciliary stripes and clear rust-red
of the sides and flanks." (Grant.)

Adult (sexes similar).--Above greenish yellow; feathers of crown with
dusky centers; lores and sides of head lighter; a circle of feathers
around eye bright yellow; under parts uniform bright yellow; wings
and tail brown, the edges of the feathers greenish yellow, those of
secondaries more yellowish. Upper mandible black; lower mandible pale
yellowish, dusky along the edge; legs and nails dark brown. Length,
115. A male from Palawan: Wing, 59; tail, 48; culmen from base, 12;
bill from nostril, 7; tarsus, 13. Female, wing, 55; tail, 48; culmen
from base, 12; bill from nostril, 6; tarsus, 13.

Young.--Three nestlings collected in Benguet Province, Luzon, on June
1, 1903, resemble the adults, but the upper parts are darker and more
greenish; rump and edges of secondaries and coverts pale yellow and
entire lower parts pale yellow, brightest on the abdomen.

"The nine specimens collected by us in Tawi Tawi have the back slightly
greener and show rather less yellow on the rump than do typical birds
from the central Philippines. A deep woods bird with rather a pleasant
song. Quite easy to obtain when once seen, as it is not at all shy.

"Three males from Tawi Tawi average: Length, 118; wing, 59; tail,
48; culmen, 14; tarsus, 13; middle toe with claw, 11. Seven females,

a wash of rufous on sides of upper breast.

I have not seen a specimen of this flycatcher and no good description
of it is available. [63] The above description is compiled from that
of C. montis. By an oversight C. montis has been credited to Palawan
by Sharpe and by McGregor and Worcester; as the only specimen of
flycatcher warbler from Palawan is the type of C. xanthopygia, the
former species must be stricken from the list of Philippine birds.



Genus EUMYIAS Cabanis, 1850.

Bill large and strong; wing considerably longer than tail; first
primary little more than one-half of second, fourth longest; tarsus
strong, longer than bill from nostril; tail nearly square, but
outermost pair of rectrices decidedly shorter than the others. The
Philippine species of Artamides are very much alike; the wings and
tail are black, and the greater part of the remaining plumage is gray,
but certain parts are barred with black and white in nearly all the
species. The sexes are unlike and the male is slightly larger than the
female. The length is usually more than 260 mm. The key to the species

    Ticao (McGregor).


Male.--Lores, feathers over nostrils, jaw, and chin black; rump and
tail-coverts barred with black and white; lower breast, abdomen, and
tail-coverts heavily barred with black and white. Iris plum-color;
bill, legs, and nails black. Length, 290; wing, 168; tail, 120;

    (1901), 3, 289; McGregor, Bur. Govt. Labs. Manila (1905), 34, 19
    (nest and egg); McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 77.

    Libagao (Porter); [64] Mindoro (Everett, Steere Exp., Whitehead,
    Bourns & Worcester); Tablas (Bourns & Worcester).


Male.--Lores, nasal plumes, line around eye, jaw, and chin black;
rest of plumage gray with no bars; very similar to the male of
A. striatus, but feathers of uropygium not fringed with white. Iris
pale yellow. Wing, 160; tail, 118; culmen from base, 26; bill from
nostril, 20; tarsus, 23.

Female.--Uniform gray, similar to the male but no black about eye,
lores, etc.; similar to female of A. guillemardi, but slightly
larger. Wing, 160; tail, 120; culmen from base, 29; bill from nostril,
21; tarsus, 24.

"The differences between A. guillemardi and A. mindorensis are very
slight. Sharpe, Ibis (1894), 254, states that the latter is lighter
gray in color than the former. On comparing specimens of these two
species we are unable to perceive the slightest difference so far
as the general color of the body is concerned. The feathers of the
throat and crown in the male of A. mindorensis are, however, lighter
gray than in the male A. guillemardi, so that the black markings on
the side of the head stand out more sharply.

"We have a large series of birds from Tablas. In nearly all of them
the under wing-coverts are barred with black and white. This we
consider to be a sign of immaturity, however, and we do not regard
them as specifically distinct from the Mindoro birds, though their
general color is slightly darker, and the black head-marking less
distinct." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

A nest and one egg were taken in Mindoro on April 26, 1905. The nest
is composed of mosses, small leaves, lichens, and fine rootlets;
the outside is covered with cobwebs which serve to hold the materials
together and to fasten the nest to the fork in which it was built. The
nest is about 115 mm. across the top and its outside depth is about
50. The ground-color of the egg is light gray with a slightly greenish
tinge; a heavy and continuous wreath of spots and blotches encircles
the shell near the plane of its short diameter; a few small spots
are scattered about over the entire surface; the deep shell-markings
vary from pale to dark lavender; the surface spots and blotches are
reddish brown; measurements, 30.7 by 21 mm.

    (1901), 3, 290; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 77.

    Cebu (Everett, Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


Male.--Lores and line of feathers around eye black; general plumage
gray; similar to A. mindorensis, but chin and nasal plumes gray. Wing,
170; tail, 130; culmen from base, 31; bill from nostril, 23; tarsus,
27.

Female.--Upper parts, throat, and breast gray; abdomen and crissum
closely barred with black and white. Wing, 166; tail, 130; culmen
from base, 28; bill from nostril, 22; tarsus, 25.



Genus MALINDANGIA Mearns, 1907.


"Wing and tail about equal; wing-feathers as in Edolisoma, third,
fourth, and fifth quills longest; tail forked, fourth quill longest,
third subequal, outer quill shortest; webs of outer pair of rectrices
sharply pointed; in form and pattern the tail resembles that of
Campochæra, but has the webs more pointed; bill with culmen decidedly
shorter than tarsus, narrower at gape than length of outer toe without
claw; stiffened shafts of rump-feathers very pronounced." (Mearns.)



452. MALINDANGIA MCGREGORI Mearns.

MCGREGOR'S CUCKOO SHRIKE.


    Malindangia mcgregori Mearns, Phil. Journ. Sci. (1907), 2,
    sec. A, 355.

    Mindanao (Mearns).


"Adult male and female.--Upper parts including crown, mantle, rump,
upper tail-coverts, and middle pair of tail-feathers uniform light
gray; forehead, chin, throat, breast, and sides of head to above eyes
black; innermost secondaries, scapulars, and least wing-coverts gray
like the back; middle and greater wing-coverts and a broad external
band on innermost pair of secondaries white; remaining wing-quills
black externally, broadly white on inner webs at base; alula all
black; axillars and under wing-coverts white; three outer rectrices
tipped with grayish white on both webs, the innermost of the three
narrowly, the next broadly, and the outermost for more than one-third
of its length; chest, flanks, and thighs gray like the back, this
color fading to whitish on the abdomen and becoming pure white on
the under tail-coverts. Iris red or reddish brown; bill all black;
feet plumbeous-black, with under side of toes yellow. Three adult
males measure: Length, 236 to 240; alar expanse, 335 to 342; wing,
110 to 113; tail, 108 to 117; culmen, 19 to 19.5; tarsus, 23 to 24;
middle toe with claw, 20 to 21. Female: Length, 230; alar expanse, 330;
wing, 108; tail, 111; culmen, 19; tarsus, 23; middle toe with claw, 21.

"Remarks.--The black of the under side of the head extends around the
neck and forms an incomplete black neck-collar which in the oldest
males is but narrowly interrupted in the median line above. The sexes
are colored alike, but one female (No. 14,177), probably immature,
has the black areas of the head and neck replaced by a dark gray
color. The plumage otherwise differs from that of the adult only
in having scarcely discernible fulvous edgings and wavy cross-bands
to the feathers of the abdomen. This species was abundant on Mount
Malindang. Fifteen specimens were collected, ten of them males and
five females." (Mearns.)



Genus EDOLISOMA Jacquinot and Pucheran, 1853.


This genus is similar to Artamides, but its members are smaller and
the bill is decidedly more slender. The plumage is unbarred in the
adult and the male has the chin, throat, forehead, and face masked in
black, or else the whole plumage is black. The young have the under
parts barred. The following key to species is modified from the one
given by Grant, Ibis (1896), 538.

    Luzon (Whitehead, McGregor); Negros (Whitehead).


Adult male (type).--Chin, throat, neck, sides of neck, head, and
mantle black with a faint dark blue gloss; lower back, rump, and upper
tail-coverts rich pompeian-orange; lower parts, except chin and throat,
rich orange, becoming more intense on under tail-coverts; thighs
blackish; wings black, crossed by two bars formed by orange-colored
areas on primaries, secondaries, and greater coverts; on the quills
these markings have corresponding spots on the inner webs which form
a diagonal band of dark buff, seen when inside of wing is examined;
lining of wing pale orange; tail from above mostly black, from below
mostly fiery orange; this results from the fact that the short outer
rectrices are black on the basal half only, while the long central
feathers are black for their whole length, the outer webs only being
orange near the tips. Length, 184; wing, 80; tail, 90; culmen from
base, about 14; tarsus, 16.

Adult female.--Markings somewhat as in the adult male, but the orange
replaced by rich lemon-yellow, which extends over the throat, sides
of neck, and chin, and also forms a narrow frontal band, the latter
extending backward on each side to over center of eye; top of head and
mantle black but without gloss. Wing, 79; tail, 89; culmen from base,
15; tarsus, 15.

Immature male.--Resembles the adult female in having the yellow frontal
band and in having chin and throat yellow; under parts pale orange
mixed with pale lemon-yellow, the under tail-coverts altogether of
the latter color; rectrices pale orange, tipped with lemon-yellow,
the central pair totally black. On the head and mantle there are
many blackish brown feathers tipped with pale buff and other glossy
black feathers of the new plumage; lower back and rump orange with
a mixture of lemon-yellow; wing-markings very light orange.

Immature female.--Almost exactly like the adult female, but many
feathers of head, mantle, sides of neck, and wings brown with buff
margins.



461. PERICROCOTUS LEYTENSIS Steere.

STEERE'S MINIVET.


    Pericrocotus leytensis Steere, List Birds & Mams. Steere
    Exped. (1890), 15; Grant, Ibis (1897), 224; Whitehead, Ibis
    (1899), 103; Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 300 and 301, nos. 8
    and 16; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 77.

    Leyte (Steere Exp., Whitehead), Samar (Bourns & Worcester,
    Whitehead, Mearns).


Male.--"An adult male has the general coloring of P. igneus, but is
larger and the central tail-feathers are tipped with vermilion. The
four outer primaries are black, and at least seven of the secondaries
have vermilion markings on the outer webs toward their tips, as well
as the broad vermilion bars across their bases. Length, 178; wing,
76; tail, 89." (Steere.)

Young.--A young female (Mearns collection) from Samar closely resembles
the corresponding plumage of P. novus from Luzon, but the bill is
decidedly longer and wider in the former specimen. Wing, 78; tail,
86; culmen from base, 15; width of bill at middle of nostril, 7.



462. PERICROCOTUS JOHNSTONIÆ Grant.

MRS. JOHNSTONE'S MINIVET.


    Pericrocotus johnstoniæ Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1905), 16,
    18; Ibis (1906), 480, pl. 19.

    Mindanao (Goodfellow, Mearns, Clemens).


"Adult male.--Most nearly allied to P. croceus Sharpe, from the south
of the Malay Peninsula, but differs in having an oblong orange-yellow
mark on the terminal portion of the outer web of the six median
secondary quills; the chin and throat glossy black like the crown and
mantle, and the breast and under parts deep yellow, less tinged with
orange. The tail-feathers are black, tipped with orange, increasing in
width, so that the outer pairs have the terminal half orange. 'Iris,
bill, and feet black.' (Goodfellow.) Length, 165; wing, 84; tail,
81; tarsus, 15.

"Adult female.--Differs considerably from the female of P. croceus
in having a narrow bright yellow band across the forehead, continued
backward over the lores in a short superciliary stripe; the chin,
throat, and all the yellow parts of the plumage bright yellow instead
of orange; the six median secondary quills with an oblong yellow mark
on the terminal half of the outer web. From the female of P. leytensis
Steere it is easily distinguished by the narrower and much brighter
yellow band across the forehead, as well as by the shining blackish
gray crown and mantle." (Grant.)

The male of Mrs. Johnstone's minivet is very similar to P. novus, but
the under parts, especially the tail-coverts, are more yellowish and
the lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts are orange-red instead of
pompeian-orange. A male from Lake Lanao, Mindanao, measures, wing, 81;
tail, 83; culmen from base, 15; width of bill at middle of nostril, 6.

orange near the base of the quills, extending along the outer web of
some of the inner primaries; ear-coverts gray; lores, feathers round
the eye, cheeks, and under surface of body bright yellow, inclining
to orange on the flanks and under tail-coverts; thighs blackish;
under wing-coverts and edge of wing yellow. Length, 140; culmen, 13;

    Luzon (Meyer, Möllendorff, Steere Exp., Whitehead, McGregor,
    Celestino).


Male.--Forehead, lores, a wide band over eye, entire sides of
head and neck, chin, throat, and fore breast velvety black; rest
of under parts deep blue; tail-coverts tipped with cobalt and the
black bases of feathers showing through the blue to some extent;
crown and nape bright cobalt; mantle, back, and rump deep blue, the
black bases showing through to some extent as on the under parts;

black. Length, about 260; wing, 135; tail, 112; culmen from base,
30; bill from nostril, 21; tarsus, 21.

Female.--Differs from the male in having the black on head and throat
duller and extending for a less distance on the breast; blue of under
parts slightly lighter. Wing, 135; tail, 113; culmen from base, 27;
bill from nostril, 19; tarsus, 18.

    Hand-List (1906), 79.

    Leyte (Steere Exp.); Samar (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    Whitehead).


"Adult male.--Crown of head and nape deep cobalt-blue as in
I. cyanogastra; sides of neck, back, and scapulars velvety black;
lower back washed with cobalt, this becoming rich cobalt on upper
tail-coverts; tail black, washed with deep cobalt; wings marked with
cobalt much as in cyanogastra; under surface deep velvety black,
feathers of abdomen slightly washed with blue; under tail-coverts
deep cobalt.

"Adult female.--Chin and throat velvety black; breast, abdomen,
and flanks purplish blue. Size that of cyanogastra. I. ellæ can be
readily distinguished from I. cyanogastra, its nearest ally, by its
black back." (Steere).

"This fine Irena was discovered by Bourns the first time that we
succeeded in reaching the woods back of the town of Catbalogan in
Samar, in 1888. Three males average, 252 in length; wing, 125; tail,
102; culmen, 31; tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw, 23. A female,
length, 257; wing, 123; tail, 103; culmen, 31; tarsus, 16; middle toe
with claw, 23. Bill, legs, feet, and nails black; iris red." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)



473. IRENA MELANOCHLAMYS Sharpe.

BLACK-MANTLED FAIRY BLUEBIRD.

    Hand-List (1901), 3, 309; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List
    (1906), 79.

    Basilan (Steere, Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    McGregor); Mindanao (Bourns & Worcester).


Adult.--Very similar to Irena cyanogastra, but the upper back and
mantle black instead of deep blue. Iris cherry red; bill, legs, and
nails black. Length, about 230. A male from Basilan measures: Wing,
121; tail, 102; culmen from base, 27; bill from nostril, 19; tarsus,
18. A female measures: Wing, 118; tail, 98; culmen from base, 28;
tarsus, 20.

"This fairy bluebird is a strictly deep woods form and a very fine
singer; it is rather shy, but can readily be procured, as it never
remains silent for any length of time. It is often difficult to
distinguish from Dicrurus striatus when seen at a little distance,
unless its tail is in plain view. All of the Philippine Irenidæ are
difficult to collect in good condition. They have very thin skins
and loose feathers, and frequently ruin themselves in falling. They
all feed on fruit. Ten males from Basilan average: Length, 236;
wing, 120; tail, 98; culmen, 30; tarsus, 18; middle toe with claw,
22. Eleven females, length, 229; wing, 116; tail, 96; culmen, 30;
tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw, 22." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Balabac (? [68]); Calamianes (Bourns & Worcester); Palawan (Steere,
    Lempriere, Whitehead, Platen, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    Celestino, White).


Male.--Crown, nape, hind neck, entire back, rump, upper and under
tail-coverts, lesser and median wing-coverts, and tips of inner greater
coverts light turquoise-blue; rest of plumage, including forehead,
lores, a wide line over eye, and entire sides of head and neck deep
black. Length, 240; wing, 127; tail, 99; culmen from base, 26; bill
from nostril, 19; tarsus, 16.

Female.--Very different from the male, being dull verditer-blue;
feathers of rump and upper and under tail-coverts tipped with brighter
blue; primaries dark brown; secondaries and rectrices dark brown,
their exposed edges washed with verditer-blue. Wing, 120; tail, 99;
culmen from base, 26; bill from nostril, 19; tarsus, 18.

"Tweeddale's fairy bluebird was fairly common about fruit trees in
the forest and was found abundantly on Mount Pulgar at an elevation
of about 750 meters. Five males from Palawan average: Length, 245;
wing, 123; tail, 95; culmen, 31; tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw,
23. Four females, length, 243; wing, 122; tail, 92; culmen, 31;
tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw, 24. Males and females from the
Calamianes average slightly less in length. Iris red; bill, legs,
feet, and nails black." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus HYPSIPETES Vigors, 1831.


Longest rictal bristles about one-half the length of tarsus; nuchal
hairs moderate in length; bill slender and compressed; a notch near
tip of upper mandible, none in lower mandible; tarsus much less
than culmen from base; difference between length of primaries and
secondaries greater than length of tarsus; tail slightly rounded;
plumage brown and gray, under parts sparsely spotted with white.

    Sa-mot', Calayan.

    Calayan (McGregor); Fuga (Whitehead, McGregor, Mearns).


Male and female.--Top of head and crest dark brown, the feathers edged
with slate-gray; back, rump, and tail-coverts warm brown or light
seal-brown, the feathers edged with olive-gray; wings and tail dark
brown; rectrices edged with olive-gray; chin, fore part of throat, and
cheeks hoary gray; a band of dark reddish brown across ear-coverts and
lower throat, many of the feathers of throat with white spots on the
tips of the shafts; rest of under parts ashy brown, becoming fulvous
on flanks and thighs; feathers on median part of breast tipped with
white; middle of abdomen white. Iris reddish brown; bill, legs, and
nails dark brown. Five males from Fuga measure: Wing, 123 to 126;
tail, 119 to 124; culmen from base, 27 to 29; bill from nostril,
16.5 to 18; tarsus, 19 to 23.

"Adult male and female.--Most nearly allied to H. squamiceps and
H. pryeri, having the chestnut ear-coverts united by a band of the
same color extending across the throat, but the top of the head,
which is almost devoid of a crest, and the neck are brown, like the
back, instead of dark slate-gray; and the white tips to the feathers
of the breast and belly are almost entirely absent, or only faintly
indicated along the middle line of the under parts. Length, 267;
culmen, 29; wing, 123; tail, 117; tarsus, 21.5." (Grant.)



476. HYPSIPETES BATANENSIS Mearns.

BATAN RED-EARED BULBUL.


    Hypsipetes batanensis Mearns, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A,
    357; McGregor, Ibid, 342.

    Pi-uc', Batan.

    Babuyan Claro (McGregor); Batan (Mearns, McGregor).


Diagnosis.--"Exactly like topotypes of Hypsipetes fugensis
Grant, but larger, and with the forehead rufescent instead of
cinereous. Measurements.--Type (skin of adult male).--Length, 262;
wing, 130; tail, 127; culmen (chord), 28; bill from anterior margin of
nostril, 20; tarsus, 26; middle toe with claw, about 27. Average of
three adult males including the type: Length, 264; wing, 128; tail,
127; culmen (chord), 28; bill from anterior margin of nostril, 26;
middle toe with claw, about 27. Adult female: Length, 245; wing, 116;
tail, 112; culmen (chord), 25; bill from anterior margin of nostril,
17.5; tarsus, 25; middle toe with claw, about 25.5." (Mearns.)

Five males measure as follows: Wing, 124 to 129; tail, 116 to 123;
culmen from base, 30 to 32; bill from nostril, 18 to 19; tarsus,
22 to 25.

Other than the size there appears to me to be no appreciable difference
between H. fugensis and H. batanensis. The Batan red-eared bulbul
is very abundant in Batan Island where it was found breeding in
May and June. The eggs are salmon-pink, spotted with shades of
umber-brown. Six eggs measure from 30.2 to 32.7 mm. in length and
from 20 to 22 mm. in width.



477. HYPSIPETES CAMIGUINENSIS McGregor.

CAMIGUIN RED-EARED BULBUL.


    Hypsipetes camiguinensis McGregor, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2,
    sec. A, 347.

    Camiguin N. (Worcester, McGregor).


Diagnosis.--Similar to H. fugensis and to H. batanensis but larger;
bill and tail longer; flanks less rufescent. Male, type: Length in
flesh, 295; wing, 136; tail, 124; culmen from base, 33; bill from
anterior margin of nostril, 21; tarsus, 25.

The specimens of Hypsipetes obtained in Camiguin Island are in such
poor condition that it is impossible to give color characters, but I
believe adults in good plumage will be found to differ considerably
from both H. fugensis and H. batanensis.



Genus IOLE Blyth, 1844.


This genus differs from Hypsipetes in having longer rictal bristles,
the longest being decidedly more than one-half as long as the tarsus,
and in having the nuchal hairs more strongly developed. The three
yellow plumaged species, Iole striaticeps, everetti, and haynaldi,
approach Criniger (=Trichophorus) both in color and in the development
of nuchal hairs, but in the latter genus the bill is relatively
shorter and the culmen is more curved.

"Everett's yellow bulbul is a deep-woods bird, and a hill bird as
well. In Samar I. philippinensis [=gularis] is found about the open
fields and in the forests of the lowlands, but as soon as one goes a
few hundred feet up on the hills I. everetti takes its place. Three
males average, 248 in length; wing, 112; tail, 96; tarsus, 20.5; middle

    Iole philippensis Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 313 (part).

    Pá-la-go, Ticao, used for Pycnonotus also.

    Bantayan (McGregor); Guimaras (Meyer, Steere Exp.); Masbate
    (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Negros (Steere, Everett, Steere
    Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead, Keay); Panay (Steere Exp.,
    Bourns & Worcester); Ticao (McGregor); Verde (McGregor).


Adult.--Very similar to Iole gularis from which it differs only in
being slightly larger and in having the throat and breast paler. Ten
males from Masbate and Ticao yield the following extreme and average
measurements: Wing, 102 to 111 (107); tail, 86 to 94 (90); exposed
culmen, 22 to 25 (23); bill from nostril, 15 to 18 (17); tarsus,
19.5 to 23 (21). Nine females from the same localities measure: Wing,
98 to 106 (99); tail, 87 to 99 (88); exposed culmen, 20.5 to 25 (21);
bill from nostril, 15 to 17 (16); tarsus, 18 to 22 (20).

"Doctor Steere separates the Iole from Panay, Guimaras, and
Negros from the Luzon, Samar, Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, and Mindanao
birds. He states that I. guimarasensis has the 'size and general
coloring of I. rufigularis, with the light shaft-streaks of
I. philippinensis.' The latter differences would not seem to be of
special value in differentiating it from I. philippinensis and we can
find nothing in the size or color of our large series of specimens
from the central Philippines to warrant us in separating them from
typical I. philippinensis [=gularis].

"Steere mentions the very different note of the Cebu birds. We were
unable to perceive the slightest difference in the notes of the birds
in question and incline to the opinion that the Doctor must have heard
the note of I. monticola when he crossed over into Cebu." (Bourns
and Worcester.)

    Mindoro (Steere Exp., Schmacker, Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead,
    McGregor, Porter); Semirara (Worcester).


Adult.--Very much like Iole gularis, but chin and throat light
drab-brown; whitish shaft-streaks less conspicuous than in either
I. gularis or I. guimarasensis; sides of breast and flanks grayer;
under parts with fewer streaks of pale yellow. Ten males measure: Wing,
102 to 107 (105); tail, 90 to 99 (95); exposed culmen, 21 to 24 (23);
bill from nostril, 15 to 18 (17); tarsus, 18 to 21 (20); Four females,
wing, 98 to 99 (98.5); tail, 91 to 95 (92); exposed culmen, 21 to 22
(21.5); bill from nostril, 15 to 16.5 (16); tarsus, 19 to 20 (19.8).

"Quite common in Mindoro. Two males average: Length, 222; wing,
100.5; tail, 91; culmen, 26; tarsus, 19; middle toe with claw, 22. A
female, length, 235; wing, 97; tail, 90; culmen, 27; tarsus, 18.5;
middle toe with claw, 21. Iris chocolate-brown; bill, legs, feet,
and nails leaden." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

On April 2, 1905, I collected, in Mindoro, a nest with three
eggs of this species. The ground-color of the eggs is white, under
shell-markings faint lavender, and entire surface thickly and uniformly
marked with elongated and twisted spots of reddish brown. The eggs
measure: 26.1 by 18.2, 25.4 by 18, and 25.1 by 19.

The nest was composed of several leaves which were held in place by
threads of a black hair-like fungus; cobweb and green moss in small
quantities also entered into the construction. The lining consisted
of a quantity of long slender fibers.

in its more ruddy upper surface, its lighter head with a wash of
ashy gray on front of crown, in its lighter ear-coverts and tawny
throat, and in its lighter under wing- and tail-coverts. So far as our
observation goes it is a highland form. It was invariably met with by
us in the forest on the tops and sides of the hills in central Cebu
and was never seen in open or flat country." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Three males average: Length, 267; wing, 121; tail, 111; culmen, 31;

female of P. unicolor Hartert, assuming that the measurement 'wing
92.5' is a typographical error for 62.5, but the bill appears to
be 2 mm. shorter. Coloration similar to that of the male and female

"Common in the deep woods of Palawan, where it is found in the tops of
low trees and in tangled vines. It hides cleverly and is difficult to
see. It is a great whistler, and can be readily called up by imitating
its note.

"Six males average: Length, 204; wing, 85; tail, 78; culmen, 23;

culmen, 24; wing, 81; tail, 61; tarsus, 33." (Sharpe.)

"Not rare in Palawan, but difficult to see, as it is shy and
protectively colored. It seems to be a very pugnacious bird, and
the males can be readily called by imitating their note. They come
apparently prepared to do battle. We found P. falcata at a height of
760 meters on Mount Pulgar.

"A male measures: Length, 203; wing, 86; tail, 70; culmen, 26; tarsus,

Adult.--Above dark or reddish brown, most of the feathers with lighter
shafts, feathers of head darker and with blackish brown margins; lores
white, some of the feathers tipped with black; line under eye white;
line over eye extending to nape white; ear-coverts brown with light
shafts, bordered below by a narrow white line which is separated from
the white chin and throat by a black line; feathers of breast, abdomen,
and tail-coverts with wide median white stripes and black edges;
sides and flanks reddish brown with lighter shafts; thighs brown;
primaries, secondaries, and rectrices blackish brown, their shafts
black, and outer edges reddish brown; wing-coverts reddish brown with
light shafts. A male measures: Wing, 70; tail, 47; culmen from base,
19; bill from nostril, 11; tarsus, 27. A female, wing, 70; tail, 46;
culmen from base, 20; bill from nostril, 11; tarsus, 27.

"Common in Basilan. Lives on the ground, or near it, and sometimes
perches on stones, fallen trees, or roots. Note not in the least like
that of P. falcata. Ptilocichla basilanica always seems loth to take
flight, and one can readily secure it by following it carefully as
it runs along the ground, uttering its complaining note at frequent
intervals. Sooner or later one is sure to catch sight of it in some
little open place, though the protective coloring makes it hard to see.

"Twenty-two males average: Length, 155; wing, 73; tail, 48; culmen,
20; tarsus, 27; middle toe with claw, 26. Fifteen females, length,

    Mindanao (Steere Exp., Platen, Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


"Above fulvous-brown; feathers of head narrowly edged with black;
feathers of back showing indistinct shaft-stripes; below much as in
P. basilanica which it equals in size also. It is readily separated
by the fulvous-brown of the head and the uniform fulvous of the
back." (Steere.)

"Habits similar to those of P. basilanica. Our specimens all show the
differences pointed out by Dr. Steere between the Mindanao and Basilan
birds, and we consider the two birds to belong to distinct species.

"A male from Mindanao measures: Length, 174; wing, 75; tail, 51;

"Sexes alike.--Feathers of the head and nape black, with heavy
rufous-brown shaft-lines; feathers of back and upper wing-coverts
bright reddish brown, with conspicuous, nearly white shaft-markings for
their entire length; tips of feathers black; the elongated feathers
of back, which reach to tail-coverts, with white shafts and white
shaft-markings broad at base and narrowing at tip, edges and extreme
tips of feathers being dark rich fulvous-brown; upper tail-coverts
rufous-brown; tail-feathers fulvous-brown edged with rufous-brown;
lores white; superciliary line white, extending as far as hind neck;
ear-coverts fulvous with light shaft-stripes, the latter becoming
rufous on hind neck, malar stripe black; chin and throat pure white;
feathers of breast and abdomen have very broad white shaft-stripes,
giving a streaked appearance to the under surface; feathers of flanks
much elongated, light fulvous-brown with distinct white shaft-stripes,
broadest at base; under tail-coverts colored like flanks; under
surface of wing fulvous-brown, brighter on coverts.

"Readily distinguished from P. basilanica by having all the feathers of
back, head, rump, and upper wing-coverts with prominent shaft-lines,
by the darker color of the long feathers of the back, and by its
much smaller size. Exceedingly rare. Length, 136; wing, 69; tail,

hop like the thrush-tribe, but has a most decided walk like the
starlings. Its note is a 'chic-chic-chic'; it is most shy and very
difficult to obtain. Iris dark brown, tip of upper mandible black,
lower light gray; feet brown.'--J. W." (Grant.)

"Only three specimens of this rare bird were obtained by us. They
were all secured in the deep forest, where they were feeding among the
leaves of low trees. We feel quite confident that we saw D. speciosa

from nostril; nasal opening oval with a large overhanging membrane;
wing pointed, not greatly curved, and slightly exceeding the tail;
rectrices well developed; tarsi and feet slender, and moderate in
length; tarsus about twice the bill from nostril. Some species in
this genus resemble species of Mixornis, but in the latter there is
no flap above the nasal opening and the feathers of the back are long
and fluffy.

"This genus is most nearly allied to Cyanoderma, but there is no
naked space around the eyes, which, on the contrary, are encircled
by a ring of short white feathers perfectly similar to that of
a true Zosterops. From Mixornis it differs in having the nostrils
long and covered by a large membrane. The tail is composed of twelve
feathers. The fifth primary is slightly longer than the fourth and
sixth; first, short, half the length of the second." (Grant.)

    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 82.

    Luzon (Whitehead).


"Male and female adult.--In general appearance this new species
resembles Mixornis montana Sharpe, from Mount Kina Balu, but it
is readily recognizable as forming a second species of the genus
Zosterornis by the shape of the nostrils and the peculiar ring of
white feathers which surrounds the eye, as well as the absence of
rufous-brown or dark chestnut on the wings so characteristic of the
genus Mixornis.

"The general color of the upper parts is dull olive, tinged with
brownish on the upper tail-coverts: quills dark brown, edged on the
outer web with olive, and on the inner with yellowish white. A marked
ring of white plumes surrounds the eye; lores and fore part of cheeks
whitish, tinged with yellow; a well-marked black eyebrow stripe from
the nostril to the posterior margin of the orbit, and a second less
distinct band below the eye; hind cheek and ear-coverts dull olive
like the crown; chin and throat uniform white, tinged with yellow and
bordered on either side by a black malar stripe; rest of the under
parts yellowish white, each feather with a wide black shaft-stripe;
tail-feathers brown, margined with olive towards the edges of the
outer webs.

"Types of the species.--Male adult: Length, 140; wing, 60; tail, 52;
tarsus, 18; culmen, 16. Female adult: Length, 140; wing, 61; tail,
52; tarsus, 18; culmen, 16." (Grant.)

    Bohol (McGregor); Leyte (Steere Exp., Whitehead); Samar (Steere
    Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead).


Adult (male and female).--Forehead, lores, and crown black, on each
side behind eye a small patch of dark chestnut; remainder of upper
parts ashy gray with lighter shaft-stripes; tail-coverts slightly
olivaceous; ear-coverts and sides of head and neck like the back;
chin and throat clear saffron-yellow, extending faintly onto fore
breast; a short stripe of dark chestnut on each side of throat;
middle of lower breast and abdomen and tail-coverts white; sides,
flanks, and thighs gray; quills brown, externally edged with dull
olivaceous, internally with white; median and lesser coverts like the
back; rectrices brown, all but the middle pair tipped with white which
increases on each pair toward the outermost, the outer webs of which
are entirely white. Length, about 145. A male from Bohol measures:
Wing, 68; tail, 62; culmen from base, 14.5; bill from nostril, 9;
tarsus, 17. A female, wing, 65.5; tail, 59; culmen from base, 15;
bill from nostril, 9.5; tarsus, 17.

"Professor Steere originally described this bird as a Mixornis,
but the structure of the nasal opening, as well as the shape of the
wing, clearly shows that it is a species of Zosterornis, most nearly
allied to Z. dennistouni Grant from Luzon. Young birds have the top
of the head brownish and the interscapular region darker than in the
adult, and both these parts have well-defined whitish shaft-stripes;
the color of the chin and throat is also paler than in the adult,
while the outer webs of the primary-quills are pale sandy.

"(The black-headed babbler is common in Samar and Leyte, and frequents
the higher branches of the undergrowth. Iris two-colored, having
an outer ring of red and an inner one of pale yellow; bill black;
legs dull lead-blue.--J. W.)" (Grant.)

"Fairly common in the deep forest of Samar. Never seen in any other
locality by us. Seven males average: Length, 140; wing, 66; tail,
59; culmen, 17; tarsus, 17; middle toe with claw, 16. Five females,
length, 139; wing, 67; tail, 57; culmen, 16; tarsus, 17; middle toe
with claw, 16. Iris varies from light brown to brick-red, in young
birds it is dull yellow; legs and feet light olive-brown, often with
a wash of yellow; nails brown to yellow; bill black. Breeding in July
and August." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Zosterornis affinis McGregor, Phil. Journ. Sci. (1907), 2,
    sec. A, 292.

    Luzon (Celestino).


Male (type).--Forehead and crown black, the shafts obscurely whitish;
a small patch of chestnut behind each eye next to the black crown;
general color above dull olive-gray, feathers of neck and mantle with
conspicuous, narrow, whitish shaft-lines; rump uniform; a narrow ring
around eye, ear-coverts, and cheeks gray with pale yellow shaft-lines;
chin, throat, and fore breast pale lemon-yellow, the chin heavily
washed with chestnut-rufous which becomes gradually less on throat
and disappears on breast; middle of breast and abdomen very pale
yellow, their sides gray, overlaid with a faint yellow wash; under
tail-coverts pale yellow; wings blackish brown, outer edges of quills
lighter and inner edges whitish; median and lesser coverts with light
shaft-lines; upper tail-coverts dull olive-brown; rectrices dark
brown, except the outermost feathers, their outer webs edged with
olive-brown, all but the center pair tipped with white, increasing in
extent toward the outermost feather which has its outer web almost
entirely white. Length, 152; wing, 68; tail, 61; culmen from base,
17; bill from nostril, 10; tarsus, 19.

This species is similar to Z. nigrocapitatus, but is slightly larger
and the back is distinctly olivaceous; the reddish brown of chin and
upper throat are diffused over these parts instead of forming a patch
on each side. The only known specimen, a male, was taken in Bataan
Province, Luzon, December 3, 1904.



Genus MIXORNIS "Hodgson" Blyth, 1842.


Rictal bristles nearly as long as bill from nostril; culmen from base a

dark chestnut; occiput, nape, sides of crown behind eye, sides of neck,
and back olive-gray; long feathers of lower back dark ocherous brown;
chin white; throat and fore breast light sulphur-yellow with narrow
black shaft-lines; remainder of under parts light olive-gray, more
yellowish along middle of breast and abdomen; wings, tail, and upper
tail-coverts rusty chestnut; primaries and secondaries edged with
white on inner webs; rectrices with narrow obsolete bars. Length,
about 140. A male measures: Wing, 60; tail, 55; culmen from base,

    Cagayan Sulu (Guillemard).


Male.--"Above grayish olive; the forehead grayish, with black shafts
to the feathers, the occipital region with a tinge of chestnut;
feathers round the eye and in the parotic region ashy; throat and
chin pure white, broadly striped with black; breast pale yellow, also
broadly striped, shading off below into the yellowish olive-gray of
the crissum and under tail-coverts; thighs with a slight reddish tint;
under wing-coverts white; wings chestnut; tail brown with traces of
dark barring. Iris pale yellow; bill and feet lead-colored. Length,
about 145; wing, 64; tail, 60; bill from gape, 18; tarsus, 20.

"This species, which was common in low bushes in the more
open situations in the island, is at once distinguishable from
M. bornensis by the upper surface being of an ashy olive-brown
instead of chestnut. It has a loud note of alarm, is very
restless in its movements, and apparently rarely flies far off the
ground." (Guillemard.)



Genus MACRONOUS Jardine and Selby, 1835.


Rictal bristles about as long as bill from nostril; nasal opening oval
and not protected by a flap; culmen from base less than tarsus; long
feathers of the back reaching to or beyond the tips of tail-coverts,
their shafts stiff and usually white; feathers on sides of body
long, decomposed, and hair-like; most of the plumage loose and
decomposed. Macronous resembles Mixornis in its long dorsal feathers,
but differs from the latter in having the shafts of these feathers
thick and stiff. Zosterornis differs from both of these genera in
having shorter dorsal plumes and in having a flap above the nasal
opening.

    Basilan (Steere, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


Adult (male and female).--Entire top and sides of head and neck
black, streaked with white; lores white; remainder of upper parts,
including exposed edges of wing- and tail-feathers, rusty tan-brown;
feathers of mantle and back with lighter shafts; chin and throat
white; feathers of breast and abdomen white with gray or brown edges,
slightly olivaceous on fore breast; flanks and tail-coverts ocherous
buff with lighter shafts; thighs ocherous buff; wing-lining and inner
edges of quills dark buff. Length, 140 to 144. A male measures: Wing,
60; tail, 54; culmen from base, 16; bill from nostril, 10; tarsus,
20. A female, wing, 60; tail, 54; culmen from base, 15.5; bill from
nostril, 10; tarsus, 21.

"The sexes are alike in size and color. Young birds are rather
more rufescent below and have the streaks on the head tinged with
rufous. Both specimens collected by Doctor Steere had the iris hazel,
but Mr. Everett gives the iris as white in all those obtained by
him." (Sharpe.)

"This species seems to be confined to the Island of Basilan, where it
is extremely common in the forest and second growth. It works about
the dense tangle of vines, and usually keeps within five to ten meters
of the ground. Thirteen males average: Length, 134; wing, 60; tail,
54; culmen, 16; tarsus, 18; middle toe with claw, 18. Eight females,
length, 130; wing, 58; tail, 53.5; tarsus, 18; middle toe with claw,

    (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead).


Adult.--Similar to Macronous striaticeps, but throat, breast, and
sides of head washed with ocherous buff or fulvous giving these parts
a soiled appearance. A male from Bohol measures: Wing, 60; tail, 53;
culmen from base, 16; bill from nostril, 10; tarsus, 20. A female from
Bohol, wing, 59; tail, 53; culmen from base, 15; bill from nostril,
9; tarsus, 19.

"Common in Mindanao and Samar. Habits exactly like those of
M. striaticeps. Four males average: Length, 144; wing, 60; tail, 56;
culmen, 16.5; tarsus, 18.5; middle toe with claw, 19. Four females,
length, 135; wing, 55; tail, 54; culmen, 14.7; tarsus, 19; middle toe
with claw, 18.5. Iris light yellow-white; legs, feet, and nails drab;
bill nearly black, the lower mandible slightly lighter than upper.

"It is remarkable that the differences between M. striaticeps and
M. mindanensis should have escaped the notice of naturalists until
they were pointed out by Doctor Steere. The two species are quite
distinct, and can be distinguished with absolute certainty." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

"Mr. Whitehead found a nest of this species [near Paranas, Samar,
June 15, 1896] containing three eggs. These were in such an advanced
stage of incubation that the young birds hatched out a few hours
after the eggs were placed in his room. Eggs pure white, thickly
speckled towards the larger end with dark red. The nest, a large
ball of bamboo leaves and loosely constructed, was placed close to
the ground in old forest." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"Adult male and female.--Similar to Macronous mindanensis mindanensis,
but very much darker with heavier markings throughout; the dark
shaft-streaks are increased in area and intensity; the blackish
feathering of the upper side of the head occupies more of the nape;
and the back and rump are prout's brown instead of raw umber; the
under parts are dark from the throat backward, the flanks being dark
isabella instead of clay-color. This mountain form (from Pantar at
610 meters and Mount Apo at 1,220 meters) is slightly smaller than
the subspecies mindanensis. It is still farther removed from Macronous

520. BRACHYPTERYX POLIOGYNA Grant.

GRANT'S SHORTWING.


    Brachypteryx poliogyna Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1895), 4,
    40; Ibis (1895), 446, pl. 12, fig. 1; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 216
    (habits); Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 56; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 83.

    Luzon (Whitehead, McGregor); Mindoro (Whitehead).


Male.--Most of the plumage dark slate-blue; middle of abdomen washed
with gray; forehead, lores, ring around eye, jaw, and chin black;
above each eye a concealed patch of soft silky white feathers;
wings and tail black, the feathers edged with slate-blue; bend of
wing white. Iris dark brown; bill, legs, and nails black. Length,
140; wing, 67; tail, 49; culmen from base, 14; bill from nostril, 9;

521. BRACHYPTERYX BRUNNEICEPS Grant.

NEGROS SHORTWING.


    Brachypteryx brunneiceps Grant, Ibis (1896), 457; Whitehead, Ibis
    (1899), 217 (habits); Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 56; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 83.

    Negros (Whitehead).


Diagnosis.--"The Negros shortwing is closely allied to B. poliogyna,
which Mr. Whitehead discovered in the highlands of Lepanto, Luzon. The
males in fact, are, as one would expect, very much alike, but the
Negros bird has the top of the head and throat washed with black
instead of dark slate. Between the females the differences are much
more marked; the crown of the head in B. brunneiceps is much darker
brown, much less strongly washed with sienna on the forehead; the chin
and middle of the throat are much deeper in color, very little paler
than the sides; and the general tone of the under parts is darker
slate-blue, the belly being in no way paler than the breast. Adult
male: Length, 127; wing, 67; tail, 48; tarsus, 29. Adult female:
Length, 132; wing, 67; tail, 48; tarsus, 29." (Grant.)



522. BRACHYPTERYX MINDANENSIS Mearns.

MINDANAO SHORTWING.


    Brachypteryx mindanensis Mearns, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. (1905),
    18, 3; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 83.

    Boor-roo-win'g, Bagobos of Mount Apo.

    Mindanao (Mearns, Goodfellow).


"Adult male.--Similar to the male of B. brunneiceps, but larger and
apparently less heavily washed with black on the top of the head and
throat. Belly without a trace of grayish wash present in B. poliogyna
from the Island of Luzon. Measurements of No. 192,256, U. S. National
Museum, from Mount Apo at 1,920 meters, July 4, 1904. Total length,
158; alar expanse, 220; wing, 70; tail, 62; bill from base of culmen,
14; bill from nostril, 9.5; tarsus, 33; middle toe with claw, 23. Iris
dark brown; bill, feet, and claws gray-black, darker than plumage.

"Adult female.--Similar to the female of B. brunneiceps, but differs
in addition to its larger size and relatively longer tail, in having
the abdomen washed with brownish gray. The wing-quills and spurious
wing are brown. Measurements of type: Length, 158; alar expanse, 212;
wing, 70; tail, 56; bill from base of culmen, 14; bill from nostril,
9; tarsus, 31; middle toe with claw, 24. Iris dark brown; bill, feet,
and claws dark gray.

"Young male in first plumage.--Slate-colored feathers of the adult
plumage are present in the greater wing-coverts and pectoral region
of the specimen (No. 192,257, U. S. National Museum, from Todava, at
1,220 meters, on Mount Apo, July 11, 1904). General color clove-brown,
the feathers slaty at base, all but the quills with russet shaft-spots,
which are small and triangular on the back, and so extended as to
give a general russet tone to the abdomen. Iris brown; bill and feet
gray-black. Length, 155; alar expanse, 218; wing, 70; tail, 50;
bill from base of culmen, 13; bill from nostril, 8.6; tarsus, 33;
middle toe with claw, 22.

"The name 'boor-roo-wi'ng,' used by the native Bagobos, is in
imitation of the lisping notes of this bird, which suggest sounds of
the winds." (Mearns.)

    Brachypteryx malindangensis Mearns, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1909),
    36, 441.

    Mindanao (Mearns).


"Characters.--Most closely related to Brachypteryx brunneiceps Grant
and B. mindanensis Mearns. Smaller than brunneiceps, about equaling
mindanensis; coloration very dark; russet of front of head intensified
to almost a burnt umber, and not extending backward beyond the eyes;

white spot. Iris dark reddish brown; bill all jet-black; feet and
claws plumbeous-black (from fresh specimen).

"Adult female (type).--Front of the head back to the eyes rusty
burnt umber, with eye-ring of same color; hind half of head, neck
all round, and all of body except abdomen, blackish slate; abdomen
washed with brownish gray; wings and tail brownish black, washed with
slate-color; edge and lining of wings slate-color, not russet. The
colors of the iris, bill, and feet were noted as exactly like those
of the male topotype.

524. PLANESTICUS MINDORENSIS (Grant).

MINDORO BLACK THRUSH. [75]


    Turdus mindorensis Grant, Ibis (1896), 465; Whitehead, Ibis
    (1899), 213 (habits).
    Merula mindorensis Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 125; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 83.

    Mindoro (Whitehead).


"Adult male.--Top and sides of the head and nape grayish brown, shading
into brownish black on the rest of the upper parts and tail; chin
whitish; throat and upper breast brownish gray, but considerably paler
than the crown; sides of the lower breast and flanks rich chestnut;
middle of the breast and belly pure white; under tail-coverts dark
gray, tinged with rufous and with wide white middles, widest toward
the extremity. Length, 229; wing, 108; tail, 88; tarsus, 30.

"Adult female.--Only differs from the male in having the brownish black
upper parts washed with dark olive, most conspicuous on the rump and
upper tail-coverts. Length, 221; wing, 108; tail, 82.5; tarsus, 30.

"In the immature male the upper parts resemble those of the female,
but most or many of the feathers on the top of the head are brownish
black and similar in color to the back of the adult male.

"In a slightly older example the head is mixed with the brownish
gray feathers of the adult plumage; in a younger bird the crown is
uniform brownish black, and the feathers of the mantle have rufous
shaft-stripes. Both these birds have the chest and upper breast mixed
with rust-colored feathers spotted with black at the extremity, and
perfectly similar to those found in the young of the common blackbird
(T. merula).

"An immature female has the top of the head and nape warm dark
brown, and the rest of the upper parts dark brown washed with olive,
as in the adult female, but few of the feathers of the mantle and
wing-coverts have narrow rufous shaft-stripes, and the throat and chest
are mostly clad in the rust and black-spotted immature plumage. The
nearly adult female differs only from the adult in having the crown
blackish brown." (Grant).



525. PLANESTICUS THOMASSONI (Seebohm).

LUZON BLACK THRUSH.


    Merula thomassoni Seebohm, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1894), 3, 41;
    Grant, Ibis (1894), 508; (1895), 445; Sharpe, Hand-List (1903),
    4, 120; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 83.
    Turdus thomassoni Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 212.

    Bul-it, Benguet.

    Luzon (Whitehead, McGregor, Mearns).


Adult.--Entire head, neck all round, chin, throat, and chest light
smoky brown, darker on forehead and crown; remainder of plumage
black; some of the feathers at sides of abdomen tipped with white;
under tail-coverts with white shaft-streaks and narrow rusty brown
tips. Bill, legs, and nails yellow. Length of a male, plumage
somewhat worn, 240; wing, 116; tail, 92; culmen from base, 22;
bill from nostril, 14; tarsus, 31. A female, wing, 118; tail, 93;
culmen from base, 24; bill from nostril, 15; tarsus, 33. Even in
adult birds there is some variation in the amount of white on the
under tail-coverts, and rusty brown fringes on the feathers of the
abdomen seem to indicate immaturity. A young male has the head and
neck black instead of chocolate-brown and the feathers of lower breast
and abdomen are liberally marked with rusty brown, this coloring the
shafts of some feathers.



526. PLANESTICUS MAYONENSIS (Mearns).

MAYON BLACK THRUSH.


    Merula mayonensis Mearns, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A, 358.

    Luzon (Mearns).


"Characters.--Pattern of coloration similar to that of Merula
thomassoni Grant, but darker, with less contrast between the coloration
of the head and that of the body. Smaller, with relatively stouter
bill; preanal feathers not tipped with white.

"Description of type (adult male).--Upper surface except head and
neck all black; under surface of body black perceptibly washed with
brown on feather edges; head and neck very dark brown, almost black
on crown; entire under surface of wings and tail dull black; under
tail-coverts black with narrow median white stripes involving the
shafts. Iris very dark brown; eyelids, bill, feet, and claws all
yellow. Female exactly like the male. A younger male than the type
differs only in having the feathers of the under side of the body
edged with yellowish brown. Length, 215; wing, 120; tail, 101; culmen
(chord measured from true base), 22; bill from anterior margin of
nostril, 13; tarsus, 34; middle toe with claw, 32.5.

"Female.--Length, 210; wing, 117; tail, 99; culmen, 20.5; bill from
nostril, 13; tarsus, 33; middle toe with claw, 32." (Mearns.)

    Pó-lo, Bagobo of Mount Apo.

    Mindanao (Mearns, Goodfellow).


Adult.--This species is almost exactly like P. thomassoni in colors,
but is considerably smaller in size. A male collected by Mearns
measures: Length, 246; wing, 110; tail, 94; culmen from base, 21;
bill from nostril, 13; tarsus, 31.

    Cat. Birds' Eggs (1905), 4, pl. 5, fig. 18; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 83.

    Negros (Whitehead).


"Adult male and female.--Above rich dark umber, darkest on the top of
the head; wings and tail brownish black; chin, throat, and chest pale
sooty brown, rather lighter on the breast, flanks, and belly; a band
of white feathers across the vent; under tail-coverts dark brown,
with pale whitish-brown tips. Bill and feet yellow. Male: Length,
241; wing, 124; tail, 96.5; tarsus, 34. Female: Length, 223.5; wing,
119; tail, 91; tarsus, 31.5.

"An immature male has the upper parts much like those of the adult,
but the feathers of the back have indistinct margins of darker color,
the chin and middle of the throat are buff, and the breast and under
parts spotted with black and washed with rufous, shading into tawny
buff on the middle of the belly.

"The Negros blackbird is resident on the volcano of Canloon at an
altitude of from 1,600 to 2,000 meters, and both young birds and eggs
were obtained." (Grant.)

A nest containing two "much incubated" eggs was taken by Whitehead
on April 12, 1896, and another nest with two young birds was found on
the 21st of the same month. The eggs are described as follows: "Shape
ovate. Ground-color very pale green; one egg very thickly mottled
with brick-red, almost hiding the ground-color; the second blotched
toward the larger end and more thinly marked over the rest of the shell
showing the very pale red-lilac clouded under-markings. As compared
with eggs of the common blackbird, the above are very much redder, and
closely resemble those of Turdus simillimus." (Grant and Whitehead.)



529. PLANESTICUS MALINDANGENSIS (Mearns).

MALINDANG BLACK THRUSH.


    Merula malindangensis Mearns, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2,
    sec. A, 357.

    Mindanao (Mearns).


"Characters.--Largest of the Philippine species of Merula. Breast
and under side of neck light drab-gray, a darker shade of this color
extending to the throat and chin and forming an indistinct collar
around the hind neck; middle of abdomen and crissum nearly white;
mantle, back, rump, and upper tail-coverts light sooty-brown; wings
and tail dark sooty-brown.

"Adult male.--Upper side of head, mantle, back, rump, and upper
tail-coverts light sooty-brown; flanks slightly paler and browner;
wings and tail dark sooty-brown, more fuliginous on under surface;
chest and under side of neck light drab-gray, a darker shade of this
color encircling the neck and extending to the chin and throat, where
the feathers have dark shaft-streaks; sides of head pale sooty-brown;
feathers of the median area from chest to crissum, with broad, white
edges and a dark central area inclosing a sagittate white spot, giving
a spotted appearance to the middle of the under surface of the body;
crissum with this light area expanded and practically all white;
under tail-coverts sooty-brown, longitudinally striped with white or
pale buff.

"Adult female.--Similar to the male but slightly smaller and dingier
in color with a slight rufescence on sides of lower breast and flanks.

"Immature male.--Sides of lower chest and flanks more strongly washed
with raw-umber than in adult females; chest and throat darker.

"First plumage (male).--Upper surface dusky, washed with raw-umber,
especially on the head, neck, upper back, and wing-coverts; scapulars
with pale rusty shaft-streaks, and some of the lesser wing-coverts
edged with the same; under surface sepia-brown strongly mixed with
reddish brown and spotted with brownish black, the rufescence covering
the middle of the throat and much of the chest, the blackish cordate
spots being confined to the tips and the rusty bands crossing the
middle of the feathers; whitish median stripe distinct but with
pale rufescent edging to the feathers except on lower abdomen;
under tail-coverts sepia-brown with rusty edging and broad, white,
median stripes.

"In other specimens taken at the same season, the molt was nearly
finished, leaving a few feathers with rusty bands and black spots and
with a stronger rusty washing to the flanks than in adults." (Mearns.)



Genus TURDUS Linnæus, 1758.

Rictal bristles weak, less than bill from nostril; wing strong,
flat, and pointed; third, fourth, and fifth primaries emarginate on
outer webs; first primary very short, less than primary-coverts; tail
nearly square; tarsus slightly less than one-third of tail and about
equal to middle toe with claw. Upper parts olive-brown, russet-brown,
or gray; chin and throat light with dusky streaks; chest, sides,
and flanks dull chestnut or gray; crissum and middle of breast and
abdomen white. This color pattern is characteristic of the three
migratory species which have been found in the Philippine Islands.

532. TURDUS OBSCURUS Gmelin.

DARK THRUSH.


    Turdus obscurus Gmelin, Syst. Nat. (1788), 1, pt. 2, 816;
    Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 212 (migration); Oates and Reid,

    Luzon (Cuming, Othberg, Whitehead); Mindanao (Goodfellow); Negros
    (Whitehead). Eastern Siberia, Japan, Eastern Himalayas and Malay
    Peninsula; in winter to China, Borneo, and Burma.


"In the adult male the general color of the upper parts is olive-brown,
tinged with gray on the crown and nape; lores very dark brown;
ear-coverts slaty brown; eye-stripe white, extending nearly to
the nape; wings, wing-coverts, and tail brown, the outer web of
each feather olive-brown, grayer on the margins of the primaries
and primary-coverts; outside tail-feathers obscurely tipped with
white on the inner web; throat and cheeks slaty brown, shading into
olive-brown on the breast and into pale chestnut-brown on the flanks,
leaving the belly white; under tail-coverts white, with basal half
edged with brown; axillars and under wing-coverts pale slate-gray,
obscurely tipped with white; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill
with upper mandible dark brown; under mandible pale yellow, darker

feet, and claws pale brown. Wing, 127 to 112; tail, 91 to 76; culmen,
22 to 20; tarsus, 32 to 28.

"The female differs from the male in not having the slaty tint on the
crown, nape, and sides of the head; the throat is white, obscurely
streaked with brown, and the flanks are very slightly suffused with
pale chestnut-brown. In spring the general color of the upper parts
has faded from russet-brown into a grayer brown, which becomes still
more gray during summer.

"Birds of the year do not entirely lose the marks of immaturity until
their second autumn molt; the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries
frequently retain the pale tips, though these are white rather than
ochraceous; the throat and eye-stripe of the female are much suffused
with ochraceous, and the throat of the male resembles that of the
adult female.

"Young in first plumage have most of the feathers of the upper parts
with pale ochraceous shafts, the feathers of the back have traces
of dark-brown terminal bars, and the wing-coverts and innermost
secondaries have pale ochraceous tips to the outside webs; on the
under parts the feathers of the cheeks and breast have dark-brown
tips, which become less conspicuous on the flanks; the throat and
eye-stripe are suffused with ochraceous." (Seebohm.)

A male from Apo Island, near Mindoro, measures: Wing, 126; tail, 97;
culmen from base, 22; bill from nostril, 13; tarsus, 30.



Genus GEOKICHLA "Boie" S. Müller, 1835.

"In the adult male in spring plumage the head is brownish chestnut,
shading into orange-chestnut on the nape; the rest of the upper
parts slate-gray; lores grayish white; no trace of eye-stripe;
ear-coverts and cheeks black, the feathers of the former with white
bases; innermost secondaries and quills dark brown; wing-coverts
nearly black; median wing-coverts white; greater wing-coverts tipped
with white; unemarginated portion of outside web of primaries pale
slate-gray; tail brown, the outside feather on each side broadly tipped
with white, and the next narrowly so; chin, throat, and upper breast
black; rest of the under parts white, suffused with ochraceous on the
flanks; the feathers of the lower breast with conspicuous fan-shaped
black terminal spots, which become obscure on the flanks; axillars,
basal portion white, terminal portion dark slate-gray; lower under
wing-coverts, basal portion black, terminal portion white; basal
portion of inner web of the secondaries and many of the primaries
white. Bill dark brown above and below. Wing with the fourth and fifth
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary between the seventh
and eighth, bastard primary, 24 to 21.5 mm. Legs, feet, and claws
flesh-color. Wing, 108 to 102; tail, 61 to 53; culmen, 19.5 to 18;
tarsus, 29 to 28. The adult plumage of the sexes appears to be alike,
nor is it known that any important change takes place by abrasion.

"Young in first plumage appear to have the whole of the upper parts
dull chestnut, each feather having a pale shaft and obscure pale
center; the white bars on the wings are suffused with chestnut, and
the black on the under parts is confined to two moustachial lines on
the cheeks, the rest being dull chestnut. This plumage is immediately
molted to the adult plumage in the first autumn, except that certain
birds, which I take to be females, have the slate-gray of the upper
parts replaced by dark olive-brown." (Seebohm.)

web on the upper side; wing and tail-feathers shaded with brown and
crossed by obsolete, wavy bars of darker; lores, eyelids, ear-coverts,
and cheeks cinereous finely mixed with pale fawn-color, the malar
region being cross-banded with black and fawn and the ear-coverts
longitudinally striped with white; chin and throat white, narrowly
cross-banded with black and bordered by black stripes; pectoral

230; wing, 125; tail, 78; culmen (chord), 35; bill from nostril, 19;
tarsus, 32; middle toe with claw, 30.

"This species was occasionally seen as it darted through the mossy
forest or alighted upon the ground; but it was so shy that only a
single specimen was shot, although its loud, sweet song was frequently
heard at morning and evening." (Mearns.)



Genus ZOOTHERA Vigors, 1831.

"In the genus Zoothera the sexes are alike, the under wing-coverts
and axillars of two colors, the colors in the one part transposed or
reversed in the other, the lower plumage squamated, not distinctly
barred nor spotted, and the rictal bristles very long and numerous. The
anterior or supplementary bristles extend over the nostrils as in
the flycatchers, and Zoothera is the only genus of thrushes in which
this feature is present. The bill is very long and strongly curved
near the tip, and the edges of the mandible are frequently serrated
by wear and tear, but never originally so." (Oates.)

parts is dark brown, approaching black on the head and on the margins
of the feathers of the back; feathers of lores and ear-coverts with
pale centers; no trace of eye-stripe; wings and tail not quite so
black as the back; chin and upper throat white, with narrow transverse
terminal black bands; cheeks pale slate-gray with broad terminal
black bands; lower throat and breast pale slate-gray; center of

diamond-shaped white centers; axillars, basal half white, terminal
half black; lower under wing-coverts, basal half black, terminal
half white; basal portions of the inner webs of the secondaries and
many of the primaries white. Bill abnormally long, dark brown above
and below; wing with the fourth primary slightly the longest, second
primary about equal to the sixth; bastard primary, 32 to 28 mm. Legs,
feet, and claws dark brown. Wing, 124 to 122; tail, 77 to 71; culmen,
29 to 28; tarsus, 34 to 33.

"It is not known that there is any difference of plumage attributable
to either sex or season. Young in first plumage have pale ochraceous
shafts to most of the feathers of the upper parts and fan-shaped,
ochraceous terminal spots to the wing-coverts. The under parts
are also much suffused with ochraceous and the breast and flanks
barred with black, the diamond-shaped pale centers being irregular
in shape." (Seebohm.)



Genus OREOCINCLA Gould, 1838.

"In the genus Oreocincla the sexes are alike, the under wing-coverts
and axillars are each of two colors, those on the axillars being
transposed or reversed in order on the under wing-coverts, the
lower plumage is distinctly barred or spotted, never squamated,
and the rictal bristles are few and confined to the gape. The tail
is typically short and the upper tail-coverts very ample. There is
a distinct pattern on the under side of the wing." (Oates.)

    Luzon (Whitehead); Mindoro (Porter). Japan and Siberia, accidental
    in Europe; China and Burma in winter.


"In the adult male in spring plumage the general color of the upper
parts is ochraceous brown, each feather having a transverse terminal
crescent-shaped black band; most of the feathers have pale shafts and
a more or less distinct ochraceous transverse subterminal band, very
conspicuous on the head and neck; lores grayish white; no trace of
eye-stripe; wing-coverts and innermost secondaries shading from dark
olive-brown on the inside webs to ochraceous brown on the outside webs,
but, with the exception of the primary-coverts, wanting the black
terminal bands; quills brown, the outside webs ochraceous brown;
four central and terminal portion on two outside tail-feathers on
each side ochraceous brown, the remaining three on each side very
dark olive-brown; five outside tail-feathers on each side more or
less distinctly tipped with white, and all more or less obscurely
barred; under parts white, with a more or less distinct tinge of
ochraceous on the breast, each feather with a transverse terminal
crescent-shaped black band, nearly obsolete on the chin, center of
belly, and under tail-coverts; axillars, basal half white, terminal
half black; under wing-coverts, basal portion black, terminal portion
white; basal half of inner web of secondaries and basal portion of
many of the primaries pale buff. Bill dark brown above, basal half

"It is not known that there is any difference in the color of the
plumage of the sexes, or in consequence of the autumn molt. Birds of
the year and young in first plumage are unknown." (Seebohm.)



Genus PETROPHILA Swainson, 1837.

Rictal bristles weak, less than bill from nostril; first primary
slender, equal to primary-coverts; outer webs of third, fourth, and
fifth primaries sinuate; tarsus little longer than middle toe with
claw; tail three times the tarsus. Males largely blue and chestnut;
females dull gray or brown, barred with blackish brown; under parts

Male.--Upper parts, sides of head and neck, chin, throat, and chest
blue, this color much obscured by gray, brown, and blackish tips
to the feathers; lower breast, abdomen, crissum, and thighs deep
chestnut, obscured by whitish tips and blackish subterminal bars;
axillars and wing-lining chestnut; wings and tail black, the feathers
edged with blue and tipped with white. Length, about 215; wing,
125; tail, 81; culmen from base, 21; bill from nostril, 14; tarsus,
27.5. This plumage is the one usually found in winter birds in the
Philippines. "At the end of winter the white fringes and subterminal
black bars on the blue parts of the plumage are entirely lost, and
the marks on the chestnut parts are also removed by abrasion in great
measure, but never entirely." (Oates.)

"The female much resembles the autumn plumage of the male, except
that the blue of the upper parts is much duller and the whole of the
under parts are pale whitish brown, suffused with pale buffish brown
on the axillaries and under wing- and tail-coverts; each feather on
the under parts has a dark brown subterminal transverse band, which on
the throat is continued on the margins of the feathers; the axillars
and the under tail-coverts have several transverse dark bars. After
the autumn molt the only perceptible difference in the female is that
the pale brown margins of the feathers are somewhat longer. Males of
the year scarcely differ from adult females, excepting in having the
ground-color of the under parts, especially on the breast and belly,
tinged with blue. Females of the year have the ground-color of the
upper parts brown, only slightly tinged with blue on the wing-coverts,
rump, and upper tail-coverts. Young in first plumage differ very
slightly from the females of the year, but have scarcely a trace of
blue." (Seebohm.)

A young female from Calayan is brown, slightly washed with dull blue
on mantle and back; feathers of mantle, back, and tail-coverts with
subterminal blackish bars and gray tips; under parts ocherous buff the
feathers with subterminal blackish bars; wings black, the feathers
tipped with white and edged with gray, tail similar; wing-lining,
axillars, and crissum richer ocherous barred with black.

"Curiously enough this bird is called 'solitaria' by the natives of
Negros on account of its habits. Always seen singly or in pairs. Common
in the villages, especially about old churches. Also abundant on the
rocks along the seashore and in open country in general; never found
in the forest. Iris dark brown; bill, legs, feet, and nails black;
food, insects.

"Six males average, 210 in length; wing, 111; tail, 85; culmen, 23;
tarsus, 27; middle toe with claw, 26. Four females, length, 210;
wing, 111; tail, 84; culmen, 23; tarsus, 27; middle toe with claw,
27." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

A specimen from Bataan Province, Luzon, appears to be much nearer
Petrophila cyanus (Linnæus) than P. manillensis; the under parts
are blue with the chestnut restricted to the axillars, wing-lining,
crissum, and a few feathers in the middle of abdomen.



Subfamily RUTICILLINÆ.


Nearly all the members of this subfamily are considerably smaller than
any of the Turdinæ. There is much diversity in the color pattern as
well as in the length and shape of the tail. The species are mostly
terrestrial.

from Siquijor measures: Wing, 92; tail, 90; culmen from base, 20;
bill from nostril, 14; tarsus, 25.

Female.--Similar to the male, but upper parts duller; forehead,
lores, chin, throat, and breast ash-gray; flanks and crissum washed
with pale fulvous. A female measures: Wing, 83; tail, 83; culmen from
base, 18; bill from nostril, 12.

Young.--Colors similar to adult in pattern, but upper parts dull
black; chin, throat, and breast dark smoke-gray, spotted with white
and pale buff.

"A showy bird, commonly seen in low bushes and about clumps of bamboo,
close to the ground, or on it. The male is constantly opening and
closing his tail, and seems to be a vain fellow, well aware of his good
looks, and disposed to make the most of them. He is a fine singer as
well. Seven males average 203 in length; wing, 107; tail, 105; culmen,
20; tarsus, 26; middle toe with claw, 24. Four females, length, 199;
wing, 84; tail, 83; culmen, 18.5; tarsus, 23; middle toe with claw,

rictal bristles small; feathers about bill and chin with the
shafts stiff, produced, and slightly recurved; wing pointed; first
primary more than one-half the second; rectrices wide and strongly
graduated. Colors largely black and white. In the type of the genus
(Kittacincla tricolor) the tail is nearly twice as long as the
wing, but in none of the Philippine species is the tail so greatly
developed. Kittacincla may be distinguished from Copsychus by its
more slender bill and wider rectrices.

    Catanduanes (Whitehead); Luzon (Kittlitz, Möllendorff, Steere Exp.,
    Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead, McGregor); Marinduque (Steere Exp.);
    Polillo (McGregor).


Male.--Head, neck, back, chin, and throat black, the upper parts with
a slight blue gloss; on each side of head from above lores to nape
a broad superciliary band of white, connected across forehead by a
narrow white band; rump and tail-coverts orange-chestnut; breast,
abdomen, and crissum white; flanks washed with orange-buff; feathers
of thighs brown with white tips; wings black; some of the primaries
narrowly edged with white, some of the greater coverts broadly tipped
with white; axillars and wing-lining white; rectrices black, the four
outer pairs broadly tipped with white. Iris and bill black; feet and
nails light flesh-color. Length, about 180 mm. A male from Bataan
Province, Luzon, measures: Wing, 82; tail, 82; culmen from base, 18;
bill from nostril, 12; tarsus, 26; middle toe with claw, 23.

Adult female.--"Top of the head, mantle, and upper back olive-brown;
lores, sides of the head and neck, and the chest dull gray, the
chin and middle of throat being somewhat paler, almost whitish;
wings washed and edged on the outer web with brown; the rest of the
plumage is very similar to that of the male. Length, 183; wing, 76;
tail, 81; tarsus, 27.

"An immature female is similar to the above, but the middle of the
chin and throat is mostly white, in somewhat marked contrast to the
gray chest and sides of the head and neck." (Grant.)

Two eggs of the Luzon shama collected at Cape Engaño, Luzon, on April
27, 1895, are thus described:

"Shape short ovate. Ground-color pale sea-green, profusely spotted
and blotched all over, especially toward the larger end, with reddish
brown and with some indistinct lilac under-markings. Measurements
21 mm. by 16 mm." Two eggs collected in the same locality on May
26, are "rather more oval in shape than the above and more richly
marked. Measurements 23 mm. by 16 mm.

"One nest was placed in the hollowed-out stem of a dead palm broken
off by the wind, the other in a hollow stump close to the ground;
in both cases the nest was composed of moss and dry grass." (Grant
and Whitehead.)

"In Marinduque we shot this species about bamboo clumps in the
open. In Luzon we invariably found it in the deep woods. A male from
Luzon measures as follows: Wing, 75; tail, 79; culmen, 18; tarsus,
25; middle toe with claw, 22. Bill black; legs, feet, and nails
flesh-color." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 86.

    Masbate (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor); Negros (Whitehead,
    Celestino); Ticao (McGregor).


Male.--General color glossy black; a broad superciliary line from
above lores to nape white; breast, abdomen, and crissum white with a
faint buff wash on flanks; feathers of thighs brown with white tips;
wings black; axillars and wing-lining white; tail black, outer pairs
of rectrices with narrow white tips, wanting in one specimen. Iris
dark; bill black; legs light flesh-color; nails light brown. Length,
165 mm. A male from Masbate measures: Wing, 84; tail, 73; culmen from
base, 20; bill from nostril, 12; tarsus, 28; middle toe with claw,
23. A male from Ticao, wing, 79; tail, 66; culmen from base, 18;
bill from nostril, 11; tarsus, 27; middle toe with claw, 22.

"A young male, nearly adult, has a few white feathers on chin and
throat and a faint wash of light buff on the flanks. A much younger
bird has many of the feathers of the back tipped with rusty brown
and the greater wing-coverts and quills washed with the same color;
chin and throat almost pure white; an ill-defined black collar;
the entire under surface washed with light buff, deeper on the flanks.

"This well-marked species is extremely rare in Masbate. It feeds
in dense thickets in the deep woods and we never heard it utter a
note. The Luzon bird, C. luzoniensis, has a superciliary stripe,
but this stripe is not nearly so broad as in this species, and as
the strongly marked superciliary line is one of the most noticeable
characters of the Masbate bird we have named it accordingly." (Bourns
and Worcester.)

    Balabac (Everett); Calamianes (Bourns & Worcester); Palawan
    (Steere, Everett, Whitehead, Platen, Steere Exp., Bourns &
    Worcester, Everett, Celestino, White).


Adult male and female.--Almost entirely glossy blue-black; some
feathers of lower abdomen, flanks, and sides of back with white shafts,
or with subterminal white spots which are more or less concealed;
under tail-coverts black, broadly tipped with white; four central
rectrices black, the others white with concealed black bases; wings
black, most of the feathers edged with glossy blue-black. Length,
215 to 220 mm. A male from Palawan measures: Wing, 88; tail, 105;
culmen from base, 17; bill from nostril, 12; tarsus, 26; middle toe
with claw, 23. A female, wing, 81; tail, 98; culmen, from base, 17;
bill from nostril, 11; tarsus, 22.

Young.--Similar to the adult but throat and breast less glossy;
abdomen, flanks, and crissum entirely white, thighs brown; the flanks
slightly washed with earthy brown. In more nearly adult plumage
the throat and breast become glossy and the white of the abdomen is
reduced in extent and broken up; the thighs become black.

"Quite common in Palawan, where we found it skulking in thickets in
the deep woods, usually near or on the ground, though it would fly
up into the trees if followed. In the Calamianes Islands we found it
abundantly in bamboo thickets.

"Four males from Palawan average: Length, 205; wing, 87; tail, 107;
culmen, 21; tarsus, 24; middle toe with claw, 22. Two females, length,
230; wing, 90; tail, 105; culmen, 20; tarsus, 25; middle toe with claw,
22. Iris dark brown to black; legs, feet, and nails brown to black;
bill black. Called by natives of Palawan 'tam-be-lad-nun'." (Bourns

    Cebu (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


Adult.--Glossy blue-black; wings black; coverts, alula, and some of
the secondaries edged with glossy blue-black; axillars and wing-lining
similar; tail black. Two adult males measure: Wing, 90, 95; tail,
105.6, 99 (imperfect); culmen from base, 19; bill from nostril, 12;
tarsus, 27, 26; middle toe with claw, 24, 23.

An immature male from Toledo, Cebu, October 13, differs from the adult
as follows: Feathers of crown and nape tipped with dull rusty brown;
wings dull seal-brown; each feather of alula and greater coverts with a
subterminal spot of ocherous brown; lesser coverts black, fringed with
silvery gray; lower parts dull blue-gray, tips of feathers ocherous,
becoming more rusty on flanks.

"An immature female is slaty black above, tail dull black; wing-coverts
brown, tipped with distinct spots of rufous-brown, these spots forming
two irregular bars; quills fulvous-brown; primaries faintly washed on
outer webs with rufous-brown; forehead brownish; lores, ring round eye,
sides of face and chin light rufous-brown; center of throat and upper
breast slaty gray, a few of the feathers still retaining brownish
centers; rest of under surface slaty black washed with brown; under
tail-coverts black with brown shaft-stripes." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Apparently confined to the island of Cebu where it is very
rare. Invariably found in the forest and in dense thickets close to
the ground. It is both quiet and shy. We never heard it utter a note.

"Two males from Cebu average: Length, 205; wing, 90; tail, 100; culmen,
20; tarsus, 26; middle toe with claw, 24. Iris very dark brown; legs,
feet, and nails dark brown, almost black; bill black. Breeding in
June." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Subfamily SAXICOLINÆ.


The two species representing this subfamily in the Philippines are
small; the upper tail-coverts are white, which is not true of the
other Philippine Turdidæ; the bill is slender and the feeding habits
are Muscicapine.

the feathers with darker centers; feathers of wing dark brown with
lighter margins; rectrices blackish brown. In worn plumage (September)
the upper parts, except uropygium, become seal-brown; wing-feathers
similar from the wearing away of the light margins; under parts darker
than in the fresh plumage. A female measures: Wing, 64; tail, 50;
culmen from base, 13; bill from nostril, 7.5; tarsus, 20.

Young.--A young male (May) resembles the female in worn plumage,
but the under parts are richer and more mottled; chin and throat buff
with blackish edges to feathers; breast and abdomen rusty ocherous, the
feathers of breast fringed with dull black; head, neck, and back smoky
black, most of the feathers marked with small buff spots; secondaries,
alula, and secondary-coverts broadly edged with rusty ocherous; edging
of alula-feathers lighter; bases of inner greater coverts pure white.

    27; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 86.

    Calayan (McGregor). Europe and northern Asia to Alaska; in winter
    to the Indian Peninsula and eastern Africa.


"Adult male in breeding plumage.--General color of the upper parts
pale slate-gray; forehead and eye-stripe, which extends to the nape,
white; lores and upper part of the ear-coverts black; wings and
wing-coverts nearly black, a few traces of the autumnal buff margins to
the feathers generally left; rump and upper tail-coverts white; tail
white except the terminal three-fifths of the two center feathers,
and the terminal fourths of the others, which are nearly black;
under parts very pale buff, slightly darker on the throat and breast;
axillars and under wing-coverts white with dark centers; inner margin
of quills brown. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. Wing with the
third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary
sometimes as long as the fourth; bastard primary, 19 to 14 mm. Wing,
106.6 to 89; (females, 94 to 87.6); tail 62 to 51; culmen, 18 to 16;
tarsus, 30 to 27.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--General color of the upper parts
dull brown; forehead and eye-stripe buffish white, much narrower than
in the male; lores and upper part of the ear-coverts brown; wings and
wing-coverts not so dark as in the male; rump and upper tail-coverts
white; tail as in the male, but the dark parts not quite so dark;
under parts as in the male. After the autumn molt both sexes have
a buffish brown margin to every feather, so that they are scarcely
distinguishable, and resemble the adult female in breeding plumage
except that the quills and tail-feathers are margined with buffish
brown at the tip, and the innermost secondaries and wing-coverts are
similarly margined, not only at the tip but along the outside webs;
the under parts are also darker in color. It is not known that birds
of the year differ from adults.

"Young in first plumage resemble the female, but have obscure
transverse terminal dark bars and pale centers to most of the feathers
of the upper and under parts." (Seebohm.)

The only specimen of the wheatear recorded from the Philippines,
a male from Calayan, measures: Wing, 97; tail, 57; culmen from base,
15; bill from nostril, 10; tarsus, 27.



Family SYLVIIDÆ.


Bill slender, short or moderately long; upper mandible with a small
notch; culmen slightly curved near the tip; nostrils exposed; rictal
bristles usually inconspicuous; wing rounded and curved to the body,
tertials much shorter than secondaries; tarsus slender, longer than
bill from gape; tail rounded, wedge-shaped, or graduate. Nearly all
the members of this family are plainly colored and the sexes closely
resemble each other. The young birds are unspotted; they either
resemble the adults, or else they are more highly colored. Some of
the genera of flycatchers are very similar to certain genera which
are here placed in the Sylviidæ.

Characteristic species of the Turdidæ, Muscicapidæ, and Sylviidæ are
easily recognized and distinguished, but the three families intergrade
through intermediate genera so that even the highest authorities on
classification are by no means agreed as to the respective limits of
these three families.



Genera.


a1. Tail with twelve rectrices.

  b1. Tail wedge-shaped, or at least decidedly rounded, the rectrices
  usually pointed.

    c1. Wing longer than tail.

      d1. First primary shorter than primary-coverts and more or
      less pointed.

        e1. Rictal bristles minute ... Locustella (p. 567)
        e2. Rictal bristles strong ... Acrocephalus (p. 569)

    Peninsula, and Burmese provinces.


Adult (sexes similar).--Above olivaceous russet-brown, each feather
with a wide seal-brown shaft-streak; primaries and secondaries
seal-brown edged with russet-brown, second primary edged with whitish;
secondary-coverts similar to back; tail nearly uniform brown; sides of

line; under parts whitish, washed with buff on fore breast, sides,
flanks, and crissum; feathers of these parts more or less marked with
blackish brown shaft-lines. Bill dusky above, flesh-color below;
legs and nails pale yellowish flesh-color. Length, 120 to 125. A

"The streaks on the lower surface become reduced in aged birds. The
bird least marked in my series has a few streaks only on the middle
of the breast and on the flanks, with one or two faint marks on
the under tail-coverts. In this state it is very like the Indian
L. straminea. The majority of the birds are densely streaked from the
chin to the tail-coverts, except on the abdomen; and all these are
characterized by a richer tone of coloring beneath. The tail-coverts
vary in the most extraordinary manner. In many of the birds they are
entirely unmarked; in others densely streaked, and this apparently
quite independently of the amount of streaking on the other parts of
the lower plumage." (Oates.)

sides, flanks, thighs, and crissum considerably darker; lores and
spot behind eye brown; eyelids pale buff; a line from nostril over
lores and eye to occiput pale buff; feathers of lores and jaws with
produced black shaft-tips. The obscure dusky streak on throat and the
pale tips to the rectrices, frequently seen in Philippine specimens,
are said to be characteristic of birds of the year. Length, about
190. A male in fresh plumage from Calayan measures: Wing, 85; tail, 77;

    Ibis (1895), 443; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 211 (habits).
    Tribura seebohmi Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 191; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 88.

    Luzon (Whitehead).


"Seebohm's grass warbler belongs to the section of the genus Lusciniola
in which the first primary is half or more than half the length of
the second, the sides of the head and ear-coverts brown, the throat
pure white and devoid of spots, and the tail considerably longer than
the wing.

"Clearly the nearest allies to this species are L. luteiventris and
L. mandellii.  In these three species the wing-formula is as follows:

"L. luteiventris. Fourth quill slightly longer than, rarely subequal
to, the fifth; third intermediate between fifth and sixth.

"L. mandellii, L. seebohmi. Fifth somewhat longer than the fourth
and sixth, which are subequal, and distinctly longer than the third.

"The present species differs from both its allies in having the general
color of the upper parts browner, the white on the chin and throat
more extensive and shading into grayish on the sides of the neck;
while the sides and flanks are more grayish brown in tint and but
slightly washed with buff; the lower mandible appears to have been
yellowish white, as in L. luteiventris. Length, 147; wing, 51; tail,
63.5; tarsus, 20; middle toe with claw, 19." (Grant.)

shorter than primaries; rectrices long, narrow, strongly graduated,
and their tips rounded; tarsus about equal to culmen from base;
outstretched feet usually reaching to, or beyond, the tip of tail;
colors largely green, chestnut, gray, and white; or green, black,

    Bourns & Worcester); Ticao (McGregor).


Adult.--Top of head from bill to neck, lores, a broad line under eye,
and upper part of ear-coverts chestnut; back, rump, and tail-coverts
slate-gray; the rump and tail-coverts green in some specimens;
wing-feathers and rectrices edged with bright olive-green; tail
with a dusky band near its tip; under parts white; throat and breast
streaked with slate-gray; sides and flanks more or less washed with
ashy gray; thighs chestnut, flanks and crissum washed with green in
some specimens. Length, about 150. A male from Bantayan measures: Wing,
57; tail, 55; culmen from base, 20; bill from nostril, 12; tarsus,
23. A female, wing, 50; tail, 46; culmen from base, 18; tarsus, 22.

"Steere has attempted to separate the Panay tailorbird from that of
Guimaras and Negros, but after a most careful examination of a large
series of specimens from Panay, Negros, and Masbate we are compelled to
say that there is not the slightest difference between the birds from
the three islands. Their size is the same. The wash of olive-green on
the back, on which Doctor Steere relied to separate the Panay birds,
is a variable character present in some birds, absent in others shot
at the same season. It occurs in birds from Negros and Masbate as
well as those from Panay. The presumptive evidence against finding
one species of Orthotomus in Panay and another in Guimaras is of
course very strong. Guimaras is to all intents and purposes a part of
Panay and there are no other known differences between the birds of
the two islands. Masbate is a new locality for the species." (Bourns
and Worcester.)

"The chestnut-headed tailorbird frequents low bushes in open country,
also the mangrove swamps; less common in the woods. A noisy bird,
its note being very similar to that of O. frontalis." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

"Shape ovate. Ground-color pure white, thinly spotted and dotted
all over with brown-lake over-markings and a few pale reddish lilac
under-markings. Measurements 16 mm. by 13 mm.

"The nest of the green-backed tailorbird is of the ordinary type,
being a pocket formed by two leaves sewn together. It was placed among
the herbage by the side of a path about 8 inches [20 cm.] from the
ground. On the 19th of May a second nest was found on a small islet
in a stream where a few slender large-leaved plants were growing
just above the water. This nest contained two young birds." (Grant
and Whitehead.)

off into brown as they approach the hind neck; throat, neck,
and under parts generally ashy gray; the center of the abdomen
and under tail-coverts pure white; thighs deep cinnamon-rufous;
under wing-coverts washed with rufous, as also is the edge of the

Adult.--Loral feathers white with black tips; ring around eye and
superciliary stripe to above ear-coverts white; remainder of head,
hind neck, sides of neck, chin, throat, and chest black; back,
rump, and tail-coverts olive-green; wing-feathers blackish, edged

563. ORTHOTOMUS SAMARENSIS Steere.

YELLOW-BREASTED TAILORBIRD.

    Exped. (1890), 20; Grant, Ibis (1897), 228; Whitehead, Ibis
    (1899), 220 (habits); Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 192; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 88.

    Bohol (McGregor); Leyte (Whitehead); Samar (Steere Exp., Bourns &
    Worcester, Whitehead).


Adult male.--Entire head, neck, chin, throat, and middle of fore
breast black; back and rump dull olive-green brighter around the neck;
rump and tail-coverts dull russet-brown; wing-feathers blackish, edged
with olive-green, the bend of wing and tips of greater median coverts
yellow; rectrices brown, edged with russet; breast, sides of breast,
and of neck, and abdomen lemon-yellow becoming olivaceous on sides,
flanks, and crissum; thighs dull chestnut. The black of fore breast is
sharply defined against the yellow, and does not extend over the sides
of the chest as it does in O. nigriceps, but is confined to the central
parts of the chest, its posterior outline being rounded. All the
specimens known have more or less white on the chin and malar region,
but this is variable in extent and is probably a sign of immaturity as
it is in O. nigriceps. A male from Bohol measures: Length, 127; wing,
44; tail, 39; culmen from base, 15; bill from nostril, 11; tarsus, 21.

The female is unknown.

"Iris light brown; bill brownish black, mandible pinkish brown; legs
yellowish flesh-color. This bird has a sweet and powerful song and
in this respect it differs from the other species. It is very shy
and difficult to obtain." (Whitehead.)

"The yellow-breasted tailorbird is extremely rare. A single specimen
was secured by the Steere Expedition, and we were able to secure
but one more. Both birds were shot in deep forest close to the
bank of a stream. Our specimen, a male, measures: Length, 114;
wing, 42.6; tail, 40; culmen, 19; tarsus, 21; middle toe with claw,
18. Iris chocolate-brown; legs, feet, and nails very light brown;
bill black. Breeding in August." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus CISTICOLA Kaup, 1829.

Bill small, slender, and sharply pointed; culmen gently curved in its
terminal half; bill from nostril equal to hind-toe without claw; wing
somewhat rounded and flat; difference between the length of primaries
and of secondaries less than first primary; first primary slender,
much less than one-half the second, the latter nearly as long as third;
fourth and fifth equal and longest; rectrices long, much graduated,
their tips rounded; the tail is similar to that of Orthotomus, but
the feathers are much wider; tarsus and feet well developed, the
outstretched toes reaching to or beyond tip of tail. Birds of this
genus present puzzling seasonal changes of plumage. The tail is longer
in the winter than in the breeding season, and the female is somewhat
smaller than the male. The seasonal variation in color is great and
has led ornithologists to name several species which do not exist. It
is not certain that the smaller species found in the Philippines is
really C. exilis, and it may be either C. erythrocephala Jerdon or
C. semirufa Cabanis. [77]

    Indo-Chinese countries, Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, Ceylon,
    China, Africa, Celebes.


Male, in worn plumage (Batan Island, June).--Above earthy brown;
head and neck nearly uniform, much faded; feathers of back and
tail-coverts with wide blackish brown centers; lores and superciliary
line white; cheeks, ear-coverts, and under parts white; flanks and
thighs ocherous-buff; wing-feathers dark or blackish brown with whitish
edges; rectrices dark brown basally, followed by a wide ocherous-buff
space, subterminal band blackish brown, wide tip white. Wing, 53;
tail, 40; culmen from base, 12; bill from nostril, 8; tarsus, 23.

Male and female in fresh plumage (Calayan Island, November).--Similar
to the male described, but feathers on head blackish brown, edged
with buff; neck, rump, and edges of dorsal feathers dark buff, more
rusty buff on rump; edges of wing-feathers wider and more rusty
than in the worn plumage; middle pair of rectrices dark buff with
blackish shaft-streaks, the shafts light; outermost pair of rectrices
with outer webs and wide tips white, the greater part of inner webs
blackish; remaining rectrices with wide white tips and subterminal
black bands, the latter fading into dark brown toward base of tail;
under part of body white; breast and crissum washed with buff; flanks
and thighs rusty buff. Male, wing, 56; tail, 53; culmen from base,
11; bill from nostril, 7; tarsus, 22. Female, wing, 48; tail, 46;
culmen from base, 10; bill from nostril, 7; tarsus, 20.

On the authority of Colonel Legge, Sharpe says that in the male the
inside of the mouth is black, while in the female it is fleshy.

"Common in the deep grass of the open fields. The habits of the various
species of this genus found in the Philippines are practically the
same. They live in the grass, and when flushed fly in a curious, jerky
way for a short distance, and then drop back into the grass where they
instantly disappear. They sometimes perch on tall grass stems or low
bushes, and make a series of noises more like the notes of some great
grasshopper than those of a bird. We several times found them perched
in trees and singing. Four females from Mindanao measure: Length, 105;
wing, 46; tail, 38; culmen, 12; tarsus, 19; middle toe with claw,
17. Legs, feet, and nails pale reddish brown; upper mandible nearly
black, lower pale at tip, black at base." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

streaked with black.

Male in non-breeding plumage resembles the female, having a streaked
crown and the under parts mostly white.

Young, in first plumage, resemble the adult in non-breeding plumage,
but the under parts, especially the face, throat, and breast, are
washed with pale lemon-yellow.

"Three males from Sulu measure: Length, 90; wing, 40.6; tail, 35.5;

this species was found breeding during April and May.

"The striated marsh warbler is found about the open fields. It runs
rapidly on the ground and skulks in bamboo thickets and patches of
tall grass and weeds. It soars and attempts to sing while on the
wing; also perches at the very top of bamboo clumps, and 'sings'
vigorously." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Worcester); Ticao (McGregor); Verde (McGregor). Northern Europe,
    northern Asia, Alaska, Commander Islands; in winter to China,

"Coloration.--Upper plumage olive-green, lighter on the rump; wings
brown, the outer webs edged with olive-green; wing-coverts brown on
the inner and olive-green on the outer webs; the median and greater
coverts with yellowish white tips forming two bars; tail brown, the
outer webs edged with olive-green; a broad and well-defined eye-streak,
reaching to the nape, yellowish white; lores brown; ear-coverts olive
mingled with yellowish; under plumage white, suffused with yellow;
under wing-coverts and axillars pale yellow.

"As the summer goes on the wing-bars get worn away and the upper one is
sometimes absent. The lower plumage gets whiter and the upper plumage
duller. After the autumn molt the wing-bars are very conspicuous and
the under parts become suffused with deeper yellow.

"Upper mandible dark brown, the edges and tip yellow; gape and basal
half of the lower mandible orange-yellow, terminal half dusky; mouth
bright orange-yellow; iris dark brown; legs flesh-color tinged with
yellow; claws yellowish horn-color. Length, 122; tail, 51; wing, 68.5;
tarsus, 20; bill from gape, 17; the second primary is intermediate
in length between the fifth and sixth, and is sometimes equal to the
sixth; the first primary is very small, measuring from 7.6 to 11.4
in length." (Oates.)

The arctic willow warbler is the commonest species of the genus
and is found in the Philippines during the winter months. Most of
the specimens taken at this time have the under parts but faintly
suffused with yellow and in this plumage the wing-bar is indicated by
light spots on the outer webs of some of the greater coverts. This
plainly colored species is usually seen flitting among the branches
of forest trees and at such heights that it can not be distinguished
from other species of similar habits.



569. ACANTHOPNEUSTE XANTHODRYAS (Swinhoe).

YELLOW WILLOW WARBLER.


    Phylloscopus xanthodryas Swinhoe, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1863), 296;
    Seebohm, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1881), 5, 42.
    Acanthopneuste xanthodryas Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 217;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 90.

    Apo (Celestino); Basilan (McGregor); Cagayancillo (McGregor);
    Cebu (McGregor); Luzon (Celestino); Mindanao (Celestino); Palawan
    (Everett). Mongolia, Japan, Kamtchatka, and the Kurile Islands;
    in winter to southern China and Borneo.


"Spring plumage.--General color of the upper parts olive, slightly
yellower on the rump; eye-stripe well defined, narrow, yellowish white,
extending to the nape; lores and the feathers behind the eye to the
nape dark olive; wing-coverts olive, the median wing-coverts with
narrow, and the greater wing-coverts with broad yellowish white tips,
forming an obscure upper wing-bar and a conspicuous lower wing-bar;
quills brown, narrowly tipped with grayish white, the outside web edged
with green and emarginated as in the preceding species; tail-feathers
brown, the outside web margined with green, and the inside web with a
narrow well defined grayish white margin; general color of the under
parts greenish yellow, grayer on the breast and flanks; axillars,
under wing-coverts, and thighs pale yellow; inner margin of quills
grayish white. Bill acrocephaline; upper mandible dark brown, under
mandible pale; legs, feet, and claws brown; third and fourth primaries
longest; second primary usually intermediate in length between the
sixth and fifth, sometimes slightly shorter than the sixth; bastard
[first] primary measuring 12.7 to 15.2 mm. Length of wing, male,
72.1 to 68.5; female, 68.5 to 66; tail, male, 53.3 to 49.5; female,
49.5 to 45.7; culmen, 12.9 to 13.9; tarsus, 20.3.

"The changes of plumage in this species are similar to those of the
preceding species, but at all seasons of the year the general color of
the under parts is much paler in color in P. borealis (Blasius). The
smaller size and smaller first primary of the latter species serve,
however, to distinguish even birds of the year from the present
species, though they approach each other very closely." (Swinhoe.)

The yellow willow warbler is undoubtedly much rarer in the
Philippines than the next preceding species, but upon a careful
examination of available material I find it necessary to refer to
this species a number of specimens which were previously recorded as
A. borealis. These changes will be found in the list of localities
under each species.



570. ACANTHOPNEUSTE LUGUBRIS (Blyth).

MOURNING WILLOW WARBLER.


    Phyllopneuste lugubris Blyth, Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. (1843),
    12, 98.
    Phylloscopus lugubris Seebohm, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1881), 5, 48.
    Acanthopneuste lugubris Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 217; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 90.

    Basilan (Steere Exp.); Mindanao (Steere); Samar (Steere
    Exp.). Western China to Chuan-che, eastern Himalayas; in winter
    to eastern Bengal and Burmese provinces.


"Coloration.--Very similar to A. magnirostris, but rather
darker and smaller, and differing also in the proportions of the
primaries. Upper mandible dark brown, lower one yellowish, somewhat
dusky on the terminal half; iris brown; mouth yellow; legs brown;
claws horn-color. Length, 127; tail, 53; wing, 66; tarsus, 19; bill
from gape, 15.7; the second primary is intermediate in length between
the ninth and tenth, and sometimes equals the tenth; the first primary
is very long, being sometimes 20.3 mm. in length." (Oates.)

I have not seen a full description of this species; it is usually
compared with A. magnirostris, but its very long first primary would
seem to be a character sufficient to prevent its being mistaken for
either of the other species found in the Philippine Islands.



Genus HORORNIS Hodgson, 1845.

Bill short and stout with a small notch near the tip; rictal bristles
few and well developed, a few short bristles in front of them;
some feathers of forehead and chin with long bristle-like shafts;

shorter or longer than tail; first primary well developed but much
(one-third to one-half) shorter than second, the latter considerably
shorter than third; tail strongly rounded; tarsus and feet strong,
hind toe and claw heavy; bill from nostril, less than one-half the
tarsus, and equal to the hind toe without claw. Colors earthy brown,

    Apo (Celestino); Calayan (McGregor); Luzon (Whitehead,
    McGregor). Southern Ussuri Land to Lake Chanka, Formosa; in winter
    to Cachar and southern China.


Adult.--Above nearly uniform wood-brown; lighter on rump and
tail-coverts; a dusky spot before and behind eye; eyelids white;
a whitish line from bill over eye to nape; cheeks and ear-coverts
buffy brown; under parts white, washed with buff on sides, flanks,
crissum, and across fore breast; thighs slate-gray; wings brown,
the feathers edged with russet; tail brown; axillars, wing-lining,
edge of wing, and inner edges of quills white. Iris brown; bill dark
brown above and light below; legs light horn. A male from Calayan
measures: Length, 170; wing, 77; tail, 75; culmen from base, 16;
bill from nostril, 9; tarsus, 27.



572. HORORNIS MINUTUS (Swinhoe).

LITTLE BUSH WARBLER.

    (1906), 91.

    Calayan (McGregor).  Hainan, Askold Island, southern China.


Adult.--This species differs from H. canturians in being much smaller,
and the tail-feathers appear to be less pointed. Length, about 145. A
male from Calayan measures: Wing, 62; tail, 61; culmen from base,
14; bill from nostril, 9; tarsus, 22. A female, wing, 62; tail,
60; culmen from base, 13; bill from nostril, 8; tarsus, 22. Exposed
portion of first primary little more than one-half of second; fourth
and fifth equal and longest.

In the Philippine Islands the little bush warbler is known only as
a winter visitant to Calayan Island.



573. HORORNIS SEEBOHMI (Grant).

PHILIPPINE BUSH WARBLER.


    Cettia seebohmi Grant, Ibis (1894), 507; Whitehead, Ibis (1899),
    211 (habits, note).
    Horornis seebohmi Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 236; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 90.

    Luzon (Whitehead, McGregor).


Adult.--Above dusky wood-brown, slightly olivaceous on the back
and more russet-brown on the rump, tail-coverts, and margins of the
rectrices; wings brown, the quills edged with russet; the first three
primaries, however, fringed with much lighter brown; wing-coverts
olivaceous; eyelids and eye-stripe whitish or pale buff; a dusky spot
before and behind eye; under parts whitish; sides of neck and breast
washed with olivaceous; flanks and crissum yellowish buff; thighs
brown. Iris light brown; upper mandible dusky, lower mandible, legs,
and nails flesh-color. Length, about 140. Male, wing, 55; tail, 63;

52; tail, 60; culmen from base, 14; bill from nostril, 8; tarsus, 23.

Although this species resembles H. minutus both in size and color,
it might be placed in another genus. The tail is decidedly longer than
the wing, the latter rounded and weak; the first primary is equal to
two-thirds of second and one-half of third; the fifth and sixth are
nearly equal and longest. The plumage is somewhat decomposed and is
less compact than in H. minutus.



Genus PHYLLERGATES Sharpe, 1883.

In size and superficial appearance Phyllergates resembles Orthotomus,
but the two genera are really very distinct. In Phyllergates the bill
is much wider and more depressed at the base, and blunter at the tip;
the rictal bristles are slightly longer; the wing is longer; the tarsus
and feet are more slender; the rectrices are much wider, nearly uniform
in length, except the short outermost pair, and but ten in number.

including edges of the wing-feathers and rectrices, olive-green;
(rump lemon-yellow in the male); inner webs of primaries edged with
white; lores and band behind eye dusky gray; ear-coverts, cheeks,
chin, throat, and fore breast silky white; remainder of under
parts, including edge of wing, axillars, and wing-lining, bright

"The swallow shrike is one of the commonest Philippine birds and
it seems probable that this species occurs on every island of the
group. It hawks after insects during the day, and may sometimes be seen
hunting in great flocks just at sundown. Hundreds often roost together
on the leaves of coconut trees. Called 'git-git' and 'ala-git-git'
by the natives. We found it nesting in the coconut trees as a rule,
but a nest in Negros was placed on the broken top of the trunk of
a cotton-tree. The nest is composed of small grass-stems, twigs,
and similar materials loosely woven together, and is lined with fine
grass and with fibers from the bark of the cabo negro palm. The cavity
of the nest is broad and shallow, measuring 75 to 100 mm. in width
and 25 to 40 mm. in depth. The exterior dimensions vary greatly in
different nests. Three or four eggs are deposited. Their ground-color
is pale creamy white, usually very heavily marked with spots and
blotches of very pale lilac and light chocolate-brown. These markings
are usually more numerous at the larger end where, in rare cases,
they almost entirely conceal the ground-color, while in others they
are replaced by fine dots and small spots. The eggs are remarkably
uniform in shape. They vary from 22.8 to 24.8 mm. in length and from
17.2 to 18 mm. in breadth." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

This attractive species was found breeding in abundance along the Baco
River, Mindoro, in April, 1904. The nests were usually placed among the
upturned roots of fallen trees which had become stranded in the river.



Family LANIIDÆ.


Bill strong, either compressed or at least as high as broad at nostril,
never depressed; upper mandible with a notch, or with a notch and a
tooth near tip; nostrils partly hidden by antrorse frontal plumes,
the shafts of which are produced; wing moderate in length, flat, and
somewhat rounded; first primary one-half of third or less, the second
falling between the first and third; rectrices twelve, either long,
or else moderate in length; front of tarsus covered with distinct
plates; hind toe with claw less than culmen from base.

    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 91.

    Sulu (Platen). Korea, China, Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra,
    and Borneo.


"Adult male (summer plumage).--Crown of head, hind neck, and upper part
of the mantle clear bluish gray; mantle, scapulars, the whole back
and the upper tail-coverts reddish brown, each feather with several
transverse black bars; lesser wing-coverts like the back, the rest
and the secondary quills chestnut-brown with submarginal black lines;
primary quills uniform brown, with no white at the base whatever;
tail uniform chestnut-brown, with faint subterminal bars and whitish
tips to the outer rectrices; a frontal band, the loral and ocular
region, and the ear-coverts deep black; all the under parts white,
washed with cream-color, especially on the throat, breast, and edge
of wings; some of the under wing-coverts with submarginal blackish
brown bars. 'Bill bluish black; feet pale leaden, with a fleshy tinge;
iris blackish brown.' (Swinhoe.)

"Winter plumage.--The gray of the head and neck is washed with
brownish; the frontal band and ear-coverts are brownish black, so that
the head has lost its beautiful appearance; cheeks, sides of breast,
and flanks with a few subterminal brown vermiculations; bill and feet
horny brown. Length, 168; culmen, 19; wing, 81; tail, 76; tarsus, 22.8.

"Adult female.--Very similar to the adult male in winter plumage,
but generally with 'a large creamy patch on the lores, and a white
half-eyebrow in rear of the eye-line' (Swinhoe); bill bluish black. The
measurements are the same as in the male.

"Observation.--Consul Swinhoe observes 'that the sexes are alike, the
males being more richly colored.' This, however, holds good only with
old females in breeding plumage, since in winter (as proved by all
the specimens from Malacca and Borneo) the female closely resembles
the young and immature birds, the black frontal band and the gray of
the head and neck being replaced by the reddish brown black-barred
coloration of the back, while the region above the ear-coverts and
above the eye is creamy instead of reddish brown.

"Immature bird.--General color of the whole upper surface of the body
reddish brown, which color is more fulvous and grayish on the head and
neck, passing into chestnut-brown on the rump and upper tail-coverts;
each feather has several very distinct black or dark-brown cross-bars,
and is mottled with small creamy or almost white spots; again, the
shafts of the feathers being white, the upper parts of the body,
especially the mantle and neck, exhibit a rather densely spotted
aspect, thus differing from the adult female in summer plumage; no
frontal band; the forehead, the region round the eye, and ear-coverts
whitish mottled with brownish; throat, middle of abdomen, under tail-
and under wing-coverts uniform cream-color; all the rest of the
under parts and sides of the neck densely marked with blackish brown
vermiculations. Bill pale horny brown; feet more bluish." (Gadow.)

"The tiger shrike is included in this list solely on the authority
of Blasius. As it occurs in Borneo its presence in the Sulu group
would not be surprising, but we failed to find it." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

    Sulu (Guillemard, Bourns & Worcester, Mearns.)


Adult male.--"Whole top [of head] and sides of neck, and hind neck
black; mantle gray (No. 10 Ridgway), fading to pale cream-buff on back;
scapulars pale cream-buff, broadly bordered with white; rump and upper
tail-coverts pinkish buff; primaries black with an exposed spot of

of the scapulars, back, and rump, as well as by the pinkish vinaceous
color of the abdomen." (Mearns.)

The long-tailed shrikes collected in Sulu by Bourns and Worcester
and by Guillemard were probably of this species. I have not seen a
specimen from Sulu.

Adult male (Bohol, April).--Lores, a narrow frontal line, and a broad
band through eye to side of neck black; forehead delicate pearl-gray,
shading gradually into earthy brown on the back and becoming more
reddish brown on the lower back and rump; chin, throat, jaw, and
middle of abdomen white; thighs pale gray; remaining under parts buff;
wing-feathers blackish; primaries whitish at their bases; axillars and
inner edges of wing-quills white; rectrices earthy brown, narrowly
tipped with whitish and obsoletely barred. Bill, legs, and nails
black. Wing, 88; tail, 87; culmen from base, 16; bill from nostril,
11; tarsus, 23.

Most of the specimens taken in the Philippines, autumn and
winter, have the under parts whitish with varying amounts of dusky
vermiculations. This plumage appears to be characteristic of both
young and winter specimens.

Young birds differ from the adults in the color of the upper parts,
which are "brownish rufous, brighter on the upper tail-coverts; no gray
on the head; loral region and a superciliary streak dingy white or
cream-color; head, hind neck, mantle, and upper tail-coverts showing
faint dark vermiculations; wing-coverts and secondary quills brown,
broadly edged with rufous, each feather with a dark brown submarginal
line; ear-coverts and a small spot in front of the eye dark brown;
chin, throat, middle of abdomen, and the under wing-coverts, axillars,
and edge of wing pale creamy white; all the rest of the under parts
more strongly washed with creamy or even with rufous, and marked
with numerous dark brown cross-vermiculations; bill brown, lighter
at base." (Gadow.)

"One of the commonest of Philippine birds. Doubtless occurs on
every island of the group. Found in open fields, where it perches on
stones, weeds, bushes, etc. It is a very noisy, quarrelsome bird,
and a vicious fighter when snared or wounded. Five males average:
Length, 186; wing, 85; tail, 84; culmen, 20; tarsus, 23; middle toe
with claw, 22. Five females, length, 188; wing, 86; tail, 82.5; culmen,
20; tarsus, 23; middle toe with claw, 21." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Genus PENTHORNIS Hellmayr, 1901.


The genus Penthornis is distinguished from Pardaliparus by its nearly
uniform black plumage and white frontal band.



Species.


a1. Wings uniform black with no white bar. ... semilarvatus (p. 608)
a2. Wings black, but with a conspicuous white bar near the base of
primaries and secondaries. ... tessacourbe (p. 608)

    Penthornis semilarvatus Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 333; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 94.

    Luzon (Whitehead, McGregor); Negros (Steere Exp.).


Adult male.--Greater part of plumage glossy black, the following
parts white: Forehead to opposite center of eye, lores, line under
eye, fore part of cheeks; a concealed patch on hind neck formed
by the white bases of the feathers; part of the inner webs of
wing and quills, wing-lining, axillars, and outer webs of under
tail-coverts white. In one specimen before me, probably immature,
the tail-coverts are entirely black. Iris light brown; bill, legs,
and nails black. Length, about 130; wing, 75; tail, 50; culmen from
base, 12; bill from nostril, 9; tarsus, 17.

mostly seal-brown but this is probably because of immaturity. Wing,
71; tail, 59; culmen from base, 12; bill from nostril, 9; tarsus, 15.



598. PENTHORNIS TESSACOURBE (Scopoli).

WHITE-WINGED BLACK TITMOUSE.


    Muscicapa tessacourbe Scopoli, Del. Flor. et Faun. Insubr. (1786),
    2, 95 (based on Sonnerat's figure).
    Muscicapa luzoniensis Gmelin, Syst. Nat. (1788), 1, pt. 2, 942
    (same basis as Scopoli's name).
    Micropus nehrkorni Blasius, Jour. für Orn. (1890), 147.
    Penthornis luzoniensis Sharpe, Hand-List (1903), 4, 333; McGregor
    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 94.

    Mindanao (Sonnerat?, Platen).


Male.--Similar to Penthornis semilarvatus, but with a broad white
band across the inner primaries and outer secondaries near their
bases. "Length, 140; wing, 78.5; tail, 53; culmen, 12.5; tarsus,
15." (Blasius.)

Muscicapa tessacourbe Scopoli and M. luzoniensis Gmelin were both
based upon Sonnerat's plate. The species was unrecognized until Platen
collected a male in Mindanao. Blasius described this specimen under
the name Micropus nehrkorni, suggesting the probability that it was
the same as Muscicapa luzoniensis. Sonnerat's figure does not look
much like a Penthornis.



Family SITTIDÆ.

nor toothed; culmen but very slightly curved; nostrils oval, nearly
hidden by the antrorse frontal plumes; shafts of the latter hair-like

long, pointed and somewhat curved; first primary equal to about
one-third of second; fourth and fifth nearly equal and longest;
second between fifth and sixth in length; tail square, very short,
scarcely more than one-half the wing; tarsus distinctly scutellate,
equal to culmen from base; three anterior toes with their basal joints
united; outer toe much longer than inner toe; hind toe with claw much
longer than tarsus and nearly equal to middle toe with claw.

are brightly marked with red or yellow, while others are plainly
colored. They feed about flower or fruit trees or vines in the manner
of the sunbirds.



Genera.


a1. Bill longer and more slender; width of upper mandible at base
not greater, usually much less, than bill from nostril; tail shorter,
not extending beyond the toes.

  b1. Bill more slender, the terminal half decidedly compressed;
  outline of gonys nearly straight; culmen from base at least twice
  the greatest width of upper mandible; short first primary wanting
  ... Dicæum (p. 622)
  b2. Bill stouter, and decidedly broad nearly to the tip; outline of
  gonys convex; culmen from base less than twice the width of upper
  mandible. ... Prionochilus (p. 637)

a2. Bill shorter and stouter; width of upper mandible at base greater
than length of bill from nostril; tail longer, its tip reaching beyond
the toes. ... Piprisoma (p. 641)



Genus DICÆUM Cuvier, 1817.

The genus Dicæum is distinguished by the slender and sharply pointed
bill, by the comparatively short tail, and by always lacking the
first primary. The shape of the bill alone is enough to distinguish
Dicæum from either Prionochilus or Piprisoma, for while the base of
the bill is stout in all three genera, in Dicæum its distal portion
is much compressed, slender and sharply pointed, and the outline of
the gonys is but very slightly convex.

the head and back are very distinctly glossed with metallic green
as in the male, though the gloss is much less pronounced. In some
females of D. ignipectus the head is slightly glossed, but the back
is always olive-green. Length, 86; wing, 46.5; tail, 28; tarsus, 12;

SULU FLOWERPECKER.


    Dicæum assimilis Bourns and Worcester, Minnesota
    Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers (1894), 1, 19; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 96.

    Sulu (Bourns & Worcester); Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester).


"Adult male.--Above exactly like D. sibutense, but chin, throat, and
fore breast very much lighter than sides of face, being clear ashy
gray, as in D. trigonostigma. As Dr. Sharpe expressly states that this
is not the case in S. sibutense, but that the latter species has the
throat like the sides of the face and head, it is evident that the
Sulu and Tawi Tawi (?) birds belong to a distinct species having the
back of D. sibutense and the under surface of D. trigonostigma.

"Adult female like that of D. sibutense, but with the throat, upper
breast, and sides of face light ashy gray, uniformly washed with
yellow. The plate in Ibis seems to show a faint orange mark on the back
of the female of D. sibutense, though no such marking is described
in the text. If this is the case, the female of D. sibutense differs
from that of every other Philippine representative of the genus.

"A male from Sulu measures 89 in length; culmen, 13; wing, 52; tail,
24.6; tarsus, 13.4. Two females from the same locality measure
84 in length; culmen, 12.7; wing, 50; tail, 24.6; tarsus, 12. We
have only females from Tawi Tawi and can not be quite sure of the
identification." (Bourns and Worcester.)

    Hand-List (1906), 97.

    Sibutu (Everett).


"This is an interesting species, new to science. Like D. trigonostigma,
it has a slate-colored throat, but the latter is blackish slate-color,
like the sides of the face and head, and not lighter gray as in
D. trigonostigma. The Sibutu bird, moreover, resembles D. dorsale
in having an orange patch in the center of the back, the lower
back and rump being slaty gray, slightly washed with olive, and
not orange-yellow as in D. trigonostigma. The female, as might be
expected, closely resembles that of D. trigonostigma, but is tinted
with olive-green on the rump, and has not the orange shade of the
hen of the last-named species." (Sharpe.) [86]

The figure of the female of D. sibutuense in The Ibis has a pale
yellow patch on the back, a character which is found in no other
Philippine species of the genus.

long, ovate in shape, pure white, and measuring 15 mm. by 12 mm.

"Nest round, pocket-shaped, with the entrance at the side, suspended
from slender boughs or to the stem of a large leaf. The outside of
the nest is made of green moss bound together with spider's webs,
the inside lined with the dark brown down stripped from the young
fern-fronds. A favorite site is a neglected native clearing some
distance from the forest." (Grant and Whitehead.)

Genus PRIONOCHILUS Strickland, 1841.


Bill short and stout, very wide at base; gonys decidedly convex; first
primary less than one-half the second or wanting. The Philippine
species that are usually placed in this genus are not uniform in
generic characters. P. johannæ has a short first primary and a
moderately stout bill; it resembles P. ignicapillus and is probably
a typical Prionochilus. P. olivaceous has a short first primary and
the bill somewhat stouter than P. johannæ. Prionochilus quadricolor,
P. bicolor, and P. inexpectatus resemble one another in having the
bill short and very stout and the true first primary absent.

9; bill from nostril, 5.5; tarsus, 13.

"This recently-described species has now been met with in Samar and
Leyte. It seems more than probable that it is not really distinct from
P. bicolor Bourns and Worcester; but having no typical specimens of
the latter form from Mindanao, I can not be certain." (Grant.)

    Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead, Celestino);
    Panay (Bourns & Worcester); Sibuyan (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor);
    Tablas (Bourns & Worcester, Celestino).


Male.--Forehead and malar stripe metallic, dark royal purple; remainder
of head, entire neck, and mantle bright poppy-red; chin, throat, and
breast scarlet-vermilion, the basal and central parts of the feathers
pale yellow; back and rump black with a median more or less concealed
patch of gamboge-yellow; tail and coverts metallic royal purple;
wings, lower breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts dead black;
axillars and wing-lining black; lesser and median wing-coverts red,
and some of the greater coverts narrowly edged with red. A male from
Cebu measures: Wing, 59; tail, 49; culmen from base, 24; bill from
nostril, 19; tarsus, 16. Upper mandible brown, lower mandible reddish
flesh; legs and nails dark brown.

Female.--Dull green with a slight reddish wash across the back;
wing-feathers and rectrices blackish brown, the latter edged with dark
crimson; wing-feathers and rump more faintly washed with crimson. A
female from Cebu, wing, 56; tail, 43; culmen from base, 22; bill from
nostril, 18; tarsus, 15.

Young birds resemble the adult female, but the young males early show
indications of the red throat and breast and of the black abdomen.

"Eight males from Negros average: Length, 133; wing, 57.6; tail, 47.4;
culmen, 25; tarsus, 15; middle toe with claw, 15. Three females from
Cebu measure: Length, 125; wing, 55; tail, 41; culmen, 25; tarsus, 16;
middle toe with claw, 16. Nine males from Sibuyan average: Length, 137;
wing, 61; tail, 51; culmen, 25; tarsus, 16; middle toe with claw, 16.

"It will be seen that the Sibuyan birds belong to a larger race, but
we do not think they can be specifically separated. Breeding in the
month of June in Cebu. Native name in Negros 'a-na-nag-bac.' Shot in
Sibuyan 1,100 meters above sea-level." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

Two eggs of the magnificent sunbird collected by Steere in Negros,
February, 1888, and three eggs collected at the base of Canlaon
Volcano by Whitehead, March 23, 1896, are described as follows:

"Shape ovate. Ground-color pale terra-cotta red, very thickly mottled
all over with a darker tint of the same color, the mottlings heaviest
at the larger end, a few fine hair-like scribblings crossing the
shell transversely. Measurements 17 mm. by 12 mm."

Another set of two eggs, collected by Whitehead in Negros, April 15,
1896, are described as having the "Ground-color as in the above,
but the shell heavily clouded with rich dark terra-cotta and darker
scribblings and specks of the same color. Measurements 16 mm. by
12 mm."

"This sunbird nests in old forest. The nest is generally found
suspended among forest débris in the vicinity of some huge tree-trunks
only a few feet from the ground. It is well hidden by the undergrowth.

"The nest is a well-woven bag-shaped structure, with a roofed entrance
at the side. It is principally constructed of fine grass, rootlets,
palm fiber, and fragments of dead leaves woven together with spiders'
webs and lined with fine dead grass tops and seeds. The nest found
by Professor Steere was suspended from a root under the overhanging
bank of a river, and looked like a tuft of rubbish left by high
water." (Grant and Whitehead.)

grow to resemble adults, the orange first showing in the middle of
the breast, the flanks and belly becoming yellow at the same time,
the pectoral tufts and richest coloring probably not appearing before
the second year." (Mearns.)

toward the larger end, and some scattered spots and blotches of the
same color over the rest of the shell, with here and there underlying
brown markings. Measurements 14 mm. by 10 mm.

"The nest built by this sunbird differs considerably from that made by
Æ. magnifica, being a long bag-shaped pocket, with a loose dangling
tail of dead leaves. The entrance is at the side and roofed over,
in fact very much like that constructed by the different species of
Cinnyris. This nest was found dangling to a bramble in an old native
clearing some distance from the forest. The female was obtained after
much difficulty." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"Adult male.--Forehead and chin metallic violet; upper tail-coverts
metallic green; tail black, edged with metallic green and violet; the
mantle, back, and outer edges of the dark brown wings olive-yellow;
chin, sides of head, sides of neck, and fore neck black, this color
extending likewise over the sides of the upper breast; no pectoral
tufts; center of fore neck and chest bright orange-red, which color
passes gradually into the pale yellow of the rest of the under
parts. Culmen, 18; wing, 51; tail, 33; tarsus, 13." (Gadow.)

"Adult male.--The metallic patch of feathers on the forehead-is
steel-green, and does not extend so far back; the rest of the
crown and nape yellowish olive-green, shading into orange on the
back; and the sides of the belly and flanks are olive-gray, pale
yellowish in the middle, with a brilliant orange-red patch above. As

of the throat metallic purplish blue, and the chest and breast velvety
black, divided up the middle by a brilliant orange-red band. Length,
102; wing, 48; tail, 30; tarsus, 14.

"A bird which appears to be a nearly adult female, though the sex
was not ascertained, differs from the female of C. guimarasensis as
described by Bourns and Worcester, Minn. Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers
(1894), I, no. 1, 55, in the following points: The head and nape
are dull olive-green, shading into brighter olive-green (instead
of brownish) on the rest of the upper parts; the sides of the
face are dull olive (not dark ashy gray); the throat and chest
gray slightly washed with yellow, rather more marked on the chin,
and the rest of the under parts are pale yellowish olive, with no
trace of the orange-yellow on the breast as described in the female
of C. guimarasensis." (Grant.)

Specimens of the flaming sunbird collected by Whitehead were
inadvertently described by Grant as new under the name Cinnyris
excellens. Grant's descriptions are included here to supplement that
by Gadow. I have not seen the species.

Male.--Above olive-green, brightest on the rump; chin, throat, and
chest glossy blue-black washed with dark aster-purple; remainder of
under parts gamboge-yellow, darkest next to the black chest-patch;
wing-feathers dark brown, outer webs edged with olive-green, inner webs
edged with white; rectrices black, two or three outer pairs tipped with
white. Bill, legs, and nails black. A male from Bohol measures: Wing,
55; tail, 38; culmen from base, 19; bill from nostril, 15; tarsus, 15.

Female.--Above similar to the male; below gamboge- or lemon-yellow,
whitish on the chin, and with obscure dusky mottlings on the throat,
brightest yellow on middle of breast and abdomen. A female from
Siquijor measures: Wing, 50; tail, 33; culmen from base, 19; bill
from nostril, 15; tarsus, 15.

The young male resembles the female and from this plumage gradually
acquires the black throat and chest. In many specimens (very
old males?) there is more or less orange next to the black chest,
while the forehead and a small area above the eye often develop a
few metallic blue feathers.

"This sunbird shows great variability in the color of the breast,
some specimens having an amount of orange approximating, but never
quite equaling, that displayed by C. aurora. Ten males average: Length,
119; wing, 56; tail, 40; culmen, 21; tarsus, 14; middle toe with claw,
14. Ten females, length, 114; wing, 52; tail, 36; culmen, 20; middle
toe with claw, 14; tarsus, 14. Bill, legs, feet, and nails black;
iris very dark brown. Breeds in February and March." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)

Three eggs of the yellow-breasted sunbird from Marinduque, May
17, 1888, collected by Steere, are described as follows: "Shape
ovate. Ground-color whitish partially obscured by the mottled gray
under markings, which cover the greater part of the shell; over
markings pale brown, with a few spots and irregular marks of a deep
brown. Measurements 16 mm. by 12 mm.

"The nest is a neatly woven pocket-shaped structure, with a roofed
entrance at the side. It is composed of fiber, dead grasses, and other
forest débris bound together with spiders' webs and lined with cotton
and fine grass." (Grant and Whitehead.)

    Bongao (Everett); Pangamian (Bartsch); Sulu (Guillemard, Platen,
    Bourns & Worcester, Bartsch); Tawi Tawi (Everett).


Hartert does not give a full description of this bird, but states that
the sides of the head are almost as red as with A. rhodolæma and that
the under side is like A. chlorigaster. I have not seen specimens of
Anthreptes from any of the Sulu group of islands.



674. ANTHREPTES CAGAYANENSIS Mearns.

CAGAYAN SULU SUNBIRD.

    Hand-List (1906), 100.

    Tal-lu-gus-lú-gus, Moros of Cagayan Sulu.

    Cagayan Sulu (Mearns).


"This is a slight insular form, most closely related to Anthreptes
wiglesworthi (Hartert), from Sulu, P. I., from which it differs in
being decidedly yellower below; the sides of the head are more reddish;
the greater wing-coverts are narrowly edged with olive instead of
broadly with ferruginous; and the bill is smaller. Iris hazel; bill all
black; feet greenish olive, with under side of toes yellow." (Mearns.)

"Characters of adult female * * *. Differs from females of Anthreptes
griseigularis in the absence of the grayish white chin and throat;
from A. chlorogaster in the yellower coloration of the middle under
parts and greener upper parts; and from A. malaccensis only in the
greater contrast of the canary-yellow of the middle under parts with
the green color of the flanks, which in A. cagayanensis are pale
oil-green, and in A. malaccensis olive-yellow. I have no female of
A. wiglesworthi for comparison. Wing, 65; tail, 47; culmen (chord),
15.5; bill from nostril, 12; tarsus, 15.8." (Mearns.)

    9, 122 (part).

    Palawan (Everett). Borneo.


"Two males from Borneo have the whole breast olive-yellow like the
abdomen and flanks; the pectoral tufts are bright yellow, and therefore
very conspicuous; under wing-coverts pale buff, edged with yellow;
median wing-coverts, scapulars, sides of head, and ear-coverts very
deep maroon-red." (Gadow.)

    & Worcester, White). Aleutian Islands?, northeastern Siberia,
    Kamchatka, China; Burma in winter; accidental in Lower California.


Adult summer plumage.--"In normal full summer plumage the forehead,
anterior part of crown, a broad supercilium, cheeks, ear-coverts,
and sides of the neck white; remainder of crown and nape, a streak
from the lores through the eye and over the ear-coverts, chin, throat,
and upper breast black; remainder of lower plumage white, shaded with
gray on the flanks; upper plumage gray, turning to black on the upper
tail-coverts; lesser wing-coverts gray; median coverts dark brown,
broadly tipped with white; greater coverts with the outer webs and
a considerable portion of the inner white; quills dark brown, edged
with white, the later secondaries very broadly so; the two outer pairs
of tail-feathers nearly entirely white, the others black." (Oates.)

Winter plumage.--A female, taken in Calayan Island in October,
1903, resembles the adult in summer as described above, but the chin
and middle of throat are white, the black patch of the chest being
crescentic in shape with its horns extending up the sides of the
throat. Iris brown; bill, legs, and nails black. Length, 200; wing,
90; tail, 92; culmen from base, 15; tarsus, 22.

Young.-- A female from Lubang Island, taken in November, 1902,
differs from the preceding specimen in having the entire top of
head and back drab-gray instead of black and ashy gray; the dark
line through eye drab-gray like the crown; the white forehead and
supercilium but faintly indicated by the white bases of the feathers.

The streak-eyed wagtail is of somewhat rare occurrence in the
Philippine Islands; it is easily distinguished by its black and white
under parts.

"A small flock of M. ocularis was observed in Palawan in December,
1891, and two specimens were obtained. They are both young birds in
first winter plumage. A male measures: Length, 178; wing, 90; tail,
97; culmen, 16.5; tarsus, 24; middle toe with claw, 20. A female,
length, 159; wing, 77; tail, 72; tarsus, 24; middle toe with claw,

    and Siberia; in winter to India, Burmese countries, Malay Peninsula
    and Indo-Malay islands.


Male (Mindoro, May, 1905).--Above ashy gray, with a slight olivaceous
wash on back; rump and tail-coverts bright greenish yellow; lores
black; line from nostril over lores, eye, and ear-coverts to nape
white; side of head ashy gray; a line from base of lower mandible
along side of throat white; chin and throat black, the feathers
fringed with white; remainder of under parts canary-yellow, paler
on sides and flanks; wing-feathers blackish brown; secondaries with
a white spot on outer web, partly concealed by the greater coverts;
tertials blacker than primaries and with inner webs largely white
and outer webs margined with white or pale yellow; outermost pair of
rectrices entirely pure white, next two pairs white with part of the
outer web black, remaining rectrices black with a fringe of greenish
yellow on outer webs. Length, 190; wing, 80; tail, 87; culmen from
base, 13; tarsus, 20.

In winter plumage the chin and throat are white, more or less
spotted with black; or else, the entire under parts are white mixed
with yellow, except the tail-coverts which seem to remain entirely
white. The latter plumage appears to be that of the young. The sexes
are similar in colors, but the breeding plumage of the female is said
to be paler than that of the male with less black on the throat.

"The gray wagtail is common and a source of constant irritation when
one is hunting the little forest kingfishers along small fresh-water
streams. M. melanope feeds among the pebbles and is always flying
up when least wanted, alarming the more valuable birds. Three males
average: Length, 185; wing, 80; tail, 92; culmen, 17; tarsus, 20;
middle toe with claw, 15. Two females, length, 189; wing, 81; tail,
96; culmen, 17.5; tarsus, 20; middle toe with claw, 17.5. Iris dark
brown; legs, feet, and nails dark brown to black; bill black, except
base of lower mandible which is gray." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus BUDYTES Cuvier, 1817.

This genus differs from Motacilla in having the tail shorter than the
wing and the claw of hind toe much longer than the toe itself. The
under parts are yellow in summer plumage, white in winter, and rarely
without traces of yellow.

Male in spring plumage (Manila, April, 1904).--Above olive-yellow;
tail-coverts brown edged with olive-yellow; top of head and nape
cinereous, the ear-coverts a little darker; lores and space under eye
blackish; a wide line from nostril over eye to nape white; sides of
neck and of chest olive-yellow; chin white; remainder of under parts
canary-yellow, or light lemon-yellow, with some obscure dusky spots on
chest, crissum palest; thighs ashy gray; wings dark seal-brown, many of
the feathers edged with yellowish or buffy white; tips of greater and
median coverts forming bars; two outermost pairs of rectrices nearly
all white, the others seal-brown with narrow olivaceous edges. Length,
165; wing, 81; tail, 72; culmen from base, 15; tarsus, 25.

The female is duller in color; the upper parts browner and the under
parts paler yellow. A female from Calayan Island measures: Wing, 74;
tail, 70; culmen from base, 13; tarsus, 25.

Winter plumage.--Most of the specimens taken in the Philippines
have the crown, sides of head, and upper parts dull brown, sepia to
hair-brown, at times with traces of olive-yellow on the back; the long
white supercilium is always present; the under parts are mostly white,
chest more or less dusky and with spots or irregular patches of yellow.

"Much less common than M. melanope. Three males average: Length, 169;
wing, 80; tail, 76; culmen, 17; tarsus, 25; middle toe with claw,
20.5. A female measures, length, 165; wing, 77; tail, 73; tarsus, 24;
middle toe with claw, 21.5. Legs, feet, and nails dark brown to black;
bill black, except base of lower mandible which is gray." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

At times I have found large flocks of this yellow wagtail in the
vicinity of Manila, but it is usually less abundant than the gray
wagtail.



Genus DENDRONANTHUS Blyth, 1844. [94]

The only member of this genus is not greatly different from the
Motacillæ, but the tail is slightly shorter than the wing, being
intermediate in length between the tertials and primaries; the
claw of hind-toe is short as in Motacilla; under parts white with
a black band across the chest; upper parts with an olivaceous wash;
wing-feathers blackish brown; median and greater coverts tipped with
white, forming two conspicuous wing-bars; primaries and secondaries
with white spots on outer webs, forming two more bars. Of this genus
Oates says: "The structure of the tail in this genus is peculiar,
inasmuch as the middle pair of feathers is very markedly shorter than
the others and of a different color."

Adult in fresh plumage.--Above sandy buff, nearly uniform on rump and
tail-coverts; upper back and top of head with dark brown shaft-lines
producing, on the head at least, a decidedly streaked appearance; lores
blackish; supercilium, from bill to nape, light buff; subocular space
buff, bounded below by a line of dark brown; malar line dark brown;
ear-coverts sandy buff; under parts cream-buff; sides and flanks sandy
buff; an ill-defined band across chest sandy buff, the feathers with
narrow, mesial, blackish streaks; wing-feathers and rectrices blackish
brown, more or less widely edged and tipped with various shades of
buff; two outer pairs of rectrices largely white. A female from Calayan
Island measures: Wing, 80; tail, 66; culmen from base, 16; tarsus,
28; hind toe with claw, 24. A female from Lubang measures: Wing, 79;
tail, 62; culmen from base, 16; tarsus, 27; hind toe with claw, 22.

As the plumage becomes worn the supercilium, subocular region, and
under parts fade to white, and the pectoral band fades to light buff.

This species is said to resemble A. richardi except in being smaller;
it is easily distinguished from any of the other pipits found in
the Philippines by the scantily streaked chest and by the uniformly
colored sides and flanks. Furthermore it is the most common species,
outnumbering, in individuals, all the other species combined.

"Enormously abundant in the open fields; it is resident throughout the
year and breeds. Four males average: Length, 167; wing, 80; tail, 65;
culmen, 18; tarsus, 28; middle toe with claw, 23. Iris dark brown;
legs and feet dirty yellow, nails darker; upper mandible dark brown
to black, under mandible light brown." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

PETCHORA PIPIT.


    Anthus gustavi Swinhoe, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1863), 90; Sharpe,
    Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1885), 10, 613; Whitehead, Ibis (1899),
    237; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 102.

    Worcester); Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester). Siberia, Kamtchatka,
    Commander Islands, Celebes; in winter to Borneo and the Molucca
    Islands; China during migration.


Adult.--Top of head, neck, and back tawny buff, each feather with a
wide mesial streak of blackish brown; on each side of mantle a series
of feathers each having either the inner or outer web buffy white,
forming on each side a conspicuous, but not well-defined, whitish
stripe; rump and tail-coverts darker than back, near raw-umber, with
narrower blackish shaft-streaks; supercilium light buff, but not
forming a well-defined line; ear-coverts tawny; malar stripe buff,
bounded below by a narrow blackish line; under parts white with a wash
of buff across the chest and with bold blackish streaks on breast,
sides, and flanks; wing-feathers blackish brown, edged with dark buff;
median and greater coverts tipped with white, forming two wing-bars;
rectrices blackish brown, the two outer pairs with considerable
white on the inner webs. A male from Calayan Island measures: Wing,
85; tail, 56; culmen from base, 16; tarsus, 22; hind toe with claw,
20. A female from northern Mindanao, wing, 80; tail, 56; culmen from
base, 15; tarsus, 22; hind toe with claw, 20.

Young birds differ from the adults in having the chin and throat
spotted with blackish brown.

The diagnostic characters of Anthus gustavi are the heavy streaks on
breast and sides, and the whitish streaks on the sides of the back.

The Petchora pipit is usually found skulking on the ground in forest;
it is never seen in flocks.



688. ANTHUS CERVINUS (Pallas).

RED-THROATED PIPIT.


    Motacilla cervina Pallas, Zoogr. Rosso-Asiat. (1811), 1,
    511. Anthus cervinus Sharpe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1885), 10,
    585; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 238 (habits); McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 102.

    Calayan (McGregor); Luzon (Whitehead); Mindanao (Steere Exp.);
    Palawan (Everett, Celestino); Alaska, Kurile Islands, Asia, Europe,
    England; in winter to China and Indo-Burmese countries, Persia
    and northwestern India, Formosa, Hainan, and northern Africa,
    accidental in Lower California.


Adult.--Above sandy gray, somewhat similar to A. gustavi, but
lighter and grayer without the whitish streaks on the sides of the
back; head streaked with dark brown; feathers of back and rump with
broad mesial streaks of blackish brown; long and broad superciliary
stripe, lores, ear-coverts, suborbital region, chin, throat, and chest
vinaceous-cinnamon or vinaceous-buff; remainder of under parts light
buff; sides, flanks, and, in many specimens, the breast, streaked with
blackish brown; wings and tail dark brown, most of the feathers with
white or sandy buff edges; greater and median coverts with whitish tips
forming two bars; two outer pairs of rectrices with wide white tips.

A male from Calayan Island measures: Length, 145; wing, 85; tail, 61;
culmen from base, 14; tarsus, 22; hind toe with claw, 20. A female
from the same locality, wing, 79; tail, 56; culmen from base, 13;
tarsus, 21; hind toe with claw, 20.

Immature birds have less vinaceous color about the head and more black
stripes on the chest; still younger birds have lores, supercilium,
malar region, chin, and throat buff with no trace of vinaceous, and
the sides of throat are thickly spotted with blackish brown. This
last plumage resembles some plumages of A. gustavi, but the latter
species seems always to have a larger bill and distinct white or pale
buff lines on the sides of the back.

The red-throated pipit in adult summer plumage is a very handsome
species. It is found in the Philippine Islands in winter only and
then but rarely.



Family ALAUDIDÆ.

Bill stout, first primary very short; tertials shorter, or but little
longer, than secondaries; tail moderate in length; two outer rectrices
partly white as in Anthus; tarsus scutellate both in front and behind;
claw of hind toe longer than the toe itself; upper plumage brown and
the breast streaked.



Genera.


a1. Bill more slender; first primary minute, shorter than
primary-coverts; claw of hind toe more than one-half the length of
tarsus. ... Alauda (p. 674)
a2. Bill much stouter; first primary longer than the primary-coverts;
claw of hind toe not more than one-half the length of
tarsus. ... Mirafra (p. 675)



Genus ALAUDA Linnæus, 1758.

Bill similar to that of Anthus, but stouter and blunter; nostrils
protected by short feathers and several hairs; rictal bristles few
and short; first primary shorter than primary-coverts; second primary
nearly as long as third, which is equal to fourth; tertials slightly
longer than secondaries; claw of hallux slender, nearly straight,
and equal to more than two-thirds the length of tarsus.



689. ALAUDA WATTERSI Swinhoe.

FORMOSAN SKYLARK.

    Bohol (Everett, McGregor); Luzon (Möllendorff, Whitehead, McGregor,
    Bartsch); Sibuyan (McGregor); Ticao (McGregor). Formosa and
    the Pescadores.


Adult.--Upper parts blackish brown, streaked with ochraceous-buff;
lores and superciliary stripe from bill to nape pale buff or whitish;
ear-coverts dusky; malar region and sides of throat marked with small
blackish spots; under parts white; chest buff with short blackish
shaft-lines; sides and flanks buff, the latter obscurely streaked
with dark brown; wing-feathers and rectrices dark brown, edged with
cream-buff or ruddy buff; outermost pair of rectrices entirely white;
the next pair with their outer webs white.

In freshly molted individuals the feathers of upper parts are rounded
at the ends and fringed with white, producing a squamate appearance,
which disappears as the plumage becomes worn; feathers of occiput
somewhat lengthened forming a crest, and the feathers of sides of
nape forming short ear-tufts.

A male in fresh plumage measures: Length, 150; wing, 85; tail, 54;
culmen from base, 15; depth of bill at nostril, 5; tarsus, 23; hind
toe with claw, 24. A female in worn plumage measures: Wing, 81; tail,
48; culmen from base, 13; depth of bill at nostril, 5; tarsus, 23;
hind toe with claw, 22.

This species is very similar to the European skylark from which it
is distinguished by its much smaller size.

Three eggs of the Formosan skylark from Isabela Province, Luzon,
collected by Whitehead on May 25, 1894, are thus described:

"Shape ovate. Ground-color very pale greenish white, variously
mottled and spotted with pale french-gray under-markings and brown
upper-markings. In one egg the markings are chiefly concentrated into
a zone round the middle of the shell; in the other two they are pretty
equally scattered over the whole shell. Measurements 21 mm. by 16 mm."

A set of two eggs is "Much like the above and equally spotted all over,
but the over-markings are of a more yellowish brown. Measurements 22
mm. by 15 mm.

"This lark was nesting in an open bit of country thinly covered
with tufts of grass, beneath which the nests were concealed. Fully
fledged young birds of this species were also observed on the same
date." (Grant and Whitehead.)



Genus MIRAFRA Horsfield, 1821.

Bill very stout, almost finch-like, its depth at nostril almost as
great as its length from nostril and equal to about two-thirds of the
hind claw; nostrils exposed; rictal bristles short; tertials shorter
than secondaries; first primary equal to one-third of the second, the
latter about equal to the third, fourth, and fifth; hallux slightly
shorter than its claw.

    Mindanao (Mearns); Mindoro (McGregor).


Adult.--Upper parts blackish brown, streaked with ochraceous-buff;
superciliary line from bill to nape dark buff; cheeks and ear-coverts
buff, speckled with black; chin and throat cream-buff; remainder
of under parts dull ochraceous-buff, darker across the chest which
is marked with small dusky spots; wing-feathers dark brown; quills
ochraceous-buff on inner webs; primaries and their coverts edged
with rusty buff on outer webs; secondaries and coverts edged with
ochraceous-buff on outer webs; tertials edged with buff on both webs;
outermost pair of rectrices with outer webs and most of the inner webs
white; next pair with outer webs white half way to the shaft. Iris
light brown; bill horn-color, lighter on lower mandible; feet and
nails light flesh-color. A male from Luzon measures: Length, 140;
wing, 70; tail, 46; culmen from base, 12; depth of bill at nostril,
65; tarsus, 21; hind toe with claw, 16. A female, wing, 68; tail,
42; culmen from base, 12; depth of bill at nostril, 6; tarsus, 21;
hind toe with claw, 15.

In young birds in fresh plumage the feathers of the back are rounded
at the tips and fringed with ochraceous-buff, and the spots on the
chest are larger.

The Philippine bush lark is very abundant in the vicinity of Manila
and great numbers have been noted in the markets in baskets with the
equally common Formosan skylark.



Family FRINGILLIDÆ.

Bill conical (except in Loxia where the mandibles are crossed);
commissure, or cutting edges of bill, angulated; [96] nostrils basal
and near the culmen, often hidden by antrorse feathers; rictal bristles

    Cu-di-li-guit, Benguet Igorot.

    Luzon (Whitehead, Worcester, McGregor).


Adult male.--Head and body geranium-red, clearest and brightest on
rump, tail-coverts, and under parts, more pinkish on throat, paler
on abdomen; lores, malar stripe, and ear-coverts dusky; feathers
of back and wing-coverts with dusky bases; thighs drab-gray; under
tail-coverts white, washed with geranium-pink, and with pointed
shaft-markings of dark brown; wings and tail blackish, the larger
feathers narrowly edged with geranium-pink. Length, about 140; wing,
82; tail, 51; culmen from base, 15; tarsus, 15.

Adult female.--Feathers of upper parts dark brown with lighter edges;
feathers of back edged with pale yellow; feathers on anterior part of
crown edged with light chrome-yellow; rump and tail-feathers nearly
uniform light chrome-yellow; nasal plumes, lores, and line under eye
whitish; cheeks and ear-coverts blackish brown; under parts drab-gray,
chin and throat nearly white; breast and abdomen with a faint olive
or yellow wash; tail-coverts white with pointed shaft-markings;
wing-feathers and rectrices blackish with narrow edges of gray or pale
yellow. A female, wing, 80; tail, 49; culmen from base, 16; tarsus, 15.

Young birds are dingy white heavily streaked, both above and below,
with blackish brown and more or less washed with olive-gray,
olive-yellow, or light chrome-yellow. Older individuals, probably
of the second summer, lose the dark streaks and become extensively
yellow, while still older males become indiscriminately mottled with
red and yellow.

"In the end of December, 1893, Mr. Whitehead noticed a pair of these
crossbills with nesting materials in their bills. In the following
January, while in the highlands of Benguet, he found a nest containing
three eggs and situated at the end of a pine branch. The slender
branch overhung a steep slope, and it was found impossible to secure
the eggs. Again on Mount Data, towards the end of January, 1895,
after much trouble, a second nest was discovered near the top of a
high pine-tree. This nest contained four young birds, two of which
flew away before they could be secured." (Grant and Whitehead.)



Genus PYRRHULA Brisson, 1760.

Bill very short, stout, and blunt; bill from nostril equal to its
width, and to its depth at middle of nostril; culmen and gonys
decidedly curved; tail nearly square. General color of body buffy
brown; chin black; rump white.

"Adult male in breeding plumage.--General color above rufous-brown,
with broad black centers to the feathers, the rump rather duller
brown; the scapulars chestnut with black centers; lesser wing-coverts
brown; median and greater coverts black, externally edged with pale
rufous-brown, with narrow white tips; bastard-wing, primary-coverts,
and quills blackish, externally fringed with brown, the primaries
margined with ashy brown, the secondaries with rufous; tail-feathers
blackish brown, edged with lighter brown, the penultimate feather
with a long wedge-shaped mark of white on the inner web; the outer
feather for the most part white, with an oblique blackish mark on
the inner web, and a small dusky mark near the end of the outer web;
center of crown vinous-chestnut, with a broad black streak along
each side, forming a band; a superciliary line, lores, sides of
face, ear-coverts, and throat vinous-chestnut, with a moustachial
line of black along the under margin of the cheeks, running behind
the ear-coverts; hind neck paler than the crown, and streaked with
whitish like the sides of the neck; remainder of under surface of body
from the lower throat downwards dull white; the center of the breast,
abdomen, and under tail-coverts uniform; the lower throat, fore neck,
and breast, as well as the sides of the body, streaked with black;
under wing-coverts and axillars white; quills dusky below, ashy along
the inner web. 'Bill brown, the lower mandible whitish; feet reddish
gray; iris brown.' (David.) Length, 122; culmen, 10; wing, 71; tail,
52; tarsus, 20.

"Adult female in breeding plumage.--Scarcely differs from the male,
but is not quite so richly colored on the throat, and less distinctly
streaked with black below.

"In winter plumage the adults are more rufous than in summer, with
rufescent edges to the feathers of the upper surface, especially on
the quills and tail-feathers; the black mark behind the ear-coverts
is more distinct and not so broken up as in the breeding plumage;
the under surface is suffused with ochraceous-buff, and the black
streaks are less pronounced.

"Young.--Resembles more the adult female in winter plumage, but has
scarcely any vinous tinge about the face; head rufous-brown, streaked
with black, with a slight band of fulvous down the center of the
crown; back fulvescent, washed with rufous and broadly streaked with
black; wing-coverts broadly edged and tipped with yellowish buff;
throat whitish, spotted with black like the breast; the latter as
well as the flanks yellowish buff, streaked with black. After the
first molt the coloration of the adult is assumed, but the plumage
is always duller and much paler, and in some birds, probably females,
the throat is white without any chestnut.

"Nestling.--Yellowish buff, broadly streaked with black, the head
more rufous, and the ear-coverts rufous; underneath white, washed
with rufous on the chin and with ochraceous-buff on the throat and
breast, thickly streaked with black on the latter as well as on the
flanks and sides of the body; wings and tail as in adults, with the
exception that the wing-coverts are more fulvous at tips." (Sharpe.)

Whitehead collected the only specimen of the little bunting which
has been recorded from the Philippine Islands.

    (1906), 104.

    Catanduanes (Whitehead). Eastern Siberia; in winter to Assam,
    Manipur, China, and eastern Himalayas; accidental in Japan.


"Adult male in summer plumage.--General color above dark brown,
the feathers of the upper back slightly washed with rufous, edged
with fulvous and broadly streaked down the middle with black;
scapulars like the back; lesser wing-coverts uniform reddish brown;
median and greater series blackish brown, externally sandy brown,
margined paler and tipped with buffy white, more distinct on the median
coverts; the inner greater coverts more distinctly rufous externally;
primary-coverts and quills dusky brown, externally fringed with ashy;
quills dusky brown, externally washed with rufous, the primaries with
ashy white; inner secondaries resembling the inner greater coverts;
lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts uniform earthy brown;
center tail-feathers light brown, the remainder dark brown, edged
with lighter brown, the penultimate one with a large wedge-shaped
mark of white near the end of the outer web, the outer feather almost
entirely white save for an oblique black mark on the inner web and
a small brown mark at the end of the outer web; head and neck all
round, including the sides of the face and neck, throat, and chest
ashy gray with a distinct wash of olive; lores, base of cheeks,
and chin black; breast pale sulphur-yellow, whiter towards the vent;
under tail-coverts pale sulphur-yellow; thighs ashy olive; sides of
breast and flanks reddish brown, rather distinctly striped with black;
axillars very pale sulphur-yellow; under wing-coverts white with dusky
bases; quills dusky below, ashy whitish along the edge of the inner

whitish; feet flesh-color; iris chestnut-brown.' (David.) Length,
120; culmen, 11.4; wing, 68.5; tail, 54.6; tarsus, 19.

"Adult male in winter plumage.--Only differs from the summer plumage
in being more olive-yellow on the head and neck, some of the feathers
of the crown and hind neck being tipped with rufous-brown.

"Adult female.--Rather browner on the head than the male and not
so ashy; no black on the face or chin; ear-coverts brown, streaked
with yellowish shaft-lines; lores, eyelid, and an indistinct eyebrow
yellowish buff; a broad cheek-stripe of pale sulphur-yellow widening
out on the side of the neck; throat and under surface of body
pale sulphur-yellow, olive greenish on the throat and fore neck;
a distinct malar streak of dusky blackish spots; sides of body and
flanks reddish brown, streaked with black; lower abdomen and under
tail-coverts yellowish white.

"Old females in the breeding season become a little more ashy on the
head and neck. Young birds are always browner than the adults above,
and have a number of dusky spots on the throat; otherwise they greatly
resemble the old females. Young females (Mus. H. Seebohm) are pale
brown above, with less developed black centers on the mantle; the head
brown, washed with rufous and streaked with black; under surface dull
white, with only a slight tinge of sulphur-yellow on the abdomen and
axillars; the throat pale olive-yellow, browner on the fore neck and
chest, with brown shaft-lines. Young males in winter plumage resemble
the adult female, but seem to have more dusky spots on the throat,
which commences to become dusky olive in April, with blackish on the
chin. Some (probably of an earlier brood) have dusky olive throats
in November, but always show dusky spots." (Sharpe.)

The only known Philippine specimen of the black-faced bunting was
collected by Whitehead.

with drab-gray; rectrices blackish, the middle pair at least edged
with olive-brown; outermost pair nearly all white, but with an oblique
blackish mark near base of inner web and a small dusky mark near tip;
next pair black with a long white mark near shaft. Upper mandible
dusky; lower mandible bluish; legs and nails flesh-color. Length,
152; wing, 71; tail, 60; culmen from base, 10; tarsus, 19.

Female.--The winter plumage of the female is very similar to that
of the male. A female from Calayan measures, wing, 65; tail, 54;
culmen from base, 9.5; tarsus, 19.

"Adult male in breeding plumage.--General color greenish gray, washed
with pale yellow; the head and mantle paler and more sulphur-yellow,
the latter with broad mesial streaks of black; the scapulars like the
mantle; the rump and lower back uniform and more distinctly ashy gray;
upper tail-coverts ashy with yellowish edges; lesser wing-coverts ashy
with a yellowish tinge; median and greater series blackish, edged with
ashy and tipped with yellowish white, the greater coverts slightly
rufescent on the outer margins; bastard-wing, primary-coverts, and
quills blackish, edged with ashy olive, the secondaries externally
rufescent, the innermost with whitish margins, so as to resemble
the inner greater coverts; center tail-feathers light brown, the
others blackish, the outer one for the most part white, excepting
a longitudinal mark along the end of the outer web and an oblique
basal mark on the inner web; penultimate feather with the white much
reduced and forming a large wedge-shaped mark on the inner web; the
third feather with only a small white mark near the end of the inner
web; ear-coverts greenish gray like the hind-neck; lores, feathers in
front of the eye, and a spot at base of chin dusky blackish; feathers

whitish along the edge of the inner web. Length, 133; culmen, 10;
wing, 72; tail, 57; tarsus, 18.

"Considerable difference exists in the full-plumaged males with regard
to the amount and intensity of the black stripes on the back. In
winter the adult male appears to be always more broadly streaked
with black on the back, the black centers becoming attenuated during
the breeding season; the mantle is also washed with rufous like the
inner secondaries.

"The adult female in breeding plumage differs but little from the
male, being duller in color and rather browner on the mantle, which
is very broadly streaked with black; it is further distinguished by
the absence of the black lores and chin spot. Length, 120; culmen,
11.4; wing, 70; tail, 53; tarsus, 18.

"Young birds in winter plumage.--Only differ from the plumage of the
adult female in being rather more olive-brown, with the rufescent
edges to the feathers of the mantle and inner secondaries broad and
strongly pronounced; lower back and rump uniform ashy olive; the under
surface of the body is clear yellow, with a tinge of saffron-color
on the throat and chest." (Sharpe.)

The Japanese yellow bunting is a somewhat abundant but inconspicuous
migrant in the Philippine Islands. It was found in Calayan Island
in November and in Tarlac Province, Luzon, in the month of March. It
has also been taken in the vicinity of Manila.

Adult.--Entire head, chin, throat, and chest blackish brown; hind
neck and sides of neck usually lighter or chocolate-brown, sharply
defined against the chestnut of back, scapulars, wing-coverts, and
edges of quills; sides of breast, flanks, and a narrow band across
breast chestnut, brighter than the back; middle of lower breast,
abdomen, thighs, and crissum, black or blackish brown; rump and
tail-coverts deep maroon; tips of longest coverts and edges of two
central rectrices golden brown or orange-rufous. Iris dark brown;
bill, legs, and nails light horn-blue. A pair from Luzon measure:
Male, length, 120; wing, 54; tail, 39; culmen from base, 11; tarsus,
16; female, wing, 54; tail, 38; culmen from base, 10; tarsus, 13.

Young.--Head and neck hair-brown; back and wing-coverts wood-brown,
tail-coverts lighter; throat creamy buff; breast, abdomen, and crissum
yellowish buff; rectrices and wing-feathers dark brown edged with buff.

The Philippine chestnut weaver, or rice bird, is abundant throughout
the Islands. It is extremely social in its habits and in many cases
a dozen of its globular nests may be found within a radius of a
few meters.

The nests are frequently built among the branches of a common species
of pandanus which grows on sandy beaches. Chestnut weavers in great
numbers, and Munia cabanisi, Padda oryzivora, and Uroloncha everetti
in lesser numbers, are captured in nets and sold, either in the Manila
markets for food or on the streets as cage-birds.

"This chestnut weaver finch feeds in large flocks and is much prized
by some of the inhabitants as an article of food, its small size
being compensated for by the fact that a score can be killed at one
discharge of a gun. It seems to breed throughout the year; its bulky
nest is placed in the grass, and is composed entirely of grass stems
and leaves; the entrance is a round opening at the side. The eggs
are pure white and more or less globular; from six to ten eggs are
deposited in a set." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



702. MUNIA FORMOSANA Swinhoe.

FORMOSAN WEAVER.


    Munia formosana Swinhoe, Ibis (1865), 366; Sharpe, Cat. Birds

    Ibis (1899), 242; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 105.

    Luzon (Whitehead).  Formosa.


Adult.--This species is very similar to M. jagori from which it may
be distinguished by its smoky brown head and neck; fore part of crown
and sides of face blacker. The measurements of the type as given by
Sharpe and changed to millimeters are: Length, 96.5; culmen, 11.4;
wing, 48; tail, 35.5; tarsus, 15.

"Munia formosana Swinhoe, of which a specimen was recorded from
Isabela, north Luzon, appears to be a distinct pale-colored form,
the head, even in freshly-molted male examples, being of a dark smoky
brown. In addition to the specimens recorded in the Catalogue of Birds,
I have examined a number of Formosan examples of this species in the
Seebohm collection." Grant, Ibis (1896), 554.

    Luzon (Meyer, Heriot, Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    Whitehead, McGregor, Bartsch); Mindoro (Porter); Panay (Bourns
    & Worcester).


Adult (sexes alike).--Upper parts, including secondary-coverts and
tertials, dark hair-brown with whitish shaft-lines; tail-coverts and
rectrices light yellowish green; lores dusky; face and ear-coverts
brown with light shaft-lines; chin and middle of throat vandyke-brown
with lighter shaft-lines; feathers on the remaining under parts white
with white shafts and white edges, each feather with a broad, median,
brown mark and a wide brown band around the feather, next to the white
edge, producing a peculiar and characteristic pattern. Iris light
brown; bill horn-blue, the upper mandible darker especially toward
the tip; legs and nails horn-blue. A male from Benguet Province,
Luzon, measures: Length, 108; wing, 48; tail, 39; culmen from base,
10.5; tarsus, 13. A female, wing, 48; tail, 36; culmen from base,
11; tarsus, 13.

Young.--Upper parts broccoli-brown, darker on crown; under parts
cream-buff, nearly white on middle of abdomen and on crissum.

Cabanis's weaver is sometimes found in small flocks, but it is much
rarer than either Munia jagori or Uroloncha everetti.

"A large flock of Cabanis's weavers was seen in an open field in
Panay, but this species was not again found by us. A female measures:
Wing, 50; tail, 37.5; culmen, 11; tarsus, 13; middle toe with claw,
17." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus UROLONCHA Cabanis, 1851.


The genus Uroloncha as represented in the Philippines differs very
little from Munia; in the two species of Uroloncha found here
the plumage is all, or nearly all, chocolate-brown, the tail is
wedge-shaped, and the central pair of rectrices, although pointed,
are less acute than in Munia.

12. A female from Palawan, wing, 50; tail, 37; culmen from base, 11;
tarsus, 12.

Young.--An immature male has the color pattern like the adult, but
the brown is lighter, the shaft-lines are less pronounced, and the
abdomen is washed with buff.

"Everett's weaver was common about the rice fields, and was several
times observed in deep forest, greatly to our astonishment. Four males
average: Length, 108; wing, 48; tail, 39; culmen, 12; tarsus, 13;
middle toe with claw, 16.5. Four females, length, 107; wing, 48.5;

abdomen tawny-rufous.



706. REICHENOWIA BRUNNEIVENTRIS (Grant).

BAMBOO WEAVER.


    Chlorura brunneiventris Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club (1894), 3,
    50; [99] Ibis (1894), 518; Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 242 (habits
    and notes); McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 105.

    Luzon (Whitehead); Mindoro (Whitehead, McGregor).


Adult.--Above including tail-coverts dark grass-green; head green;
forehead blue with a narrow black band along base of bill; lores, sides
of face, ear-coverts, and under parts tawny-rufous, paler posteriorly;
sides of breast green, washed with blue; sides of body and flanks
grass-green; primaries edged with olive-yellow; tail-feathers green
at ends; center ones green, washed with orange. "Iris dark brown;
bill black; feet flesh-color." (Whitehead.)  Length, 106; wing, 58.

This curiously colored weaver appears to be very rare or, at any rate,
to be difficult to collect. Whitehead's interesting notes on this
species follow:

"These small bamboo sparrows are always difficult to obtain; being wary
and of swift flight, they disappear in a second when alarmed. Amongst
the bamboo-flowers, on which they feed, their movements are very slow
and quiet, and it is only after one has found a number of bamboo-clumps
in full flower, by carefully hiding and watching the flowers, that
any success is obtained. My first specimens were collected in Benguet
at an elevation of only 2,000 feet [610 meters], and we next met
with the species again at 7,600 feet [2,300 meters] on Monte Data,
where a single specimen was secured. In Mindoro I shot a Chlorura
[=Reichenowia] in a pine tree close to my camp, and noticed another
some days previously feeding at the end of a pine branch; this was
at an elevation of 4,500 feet [1,370 meters]. The note, which seems
only to be uttered when the bird is on the wing, is 'tsit, tsit,'
and is a somewhat hissing sound."

slightly curved throughout; gonys straight or slightly curved; a small
but distinct notch near tip of bill; nostril oval, exposed, and nearer
to cutting edge of mandible than to culmen; rictal bristles short;
wing long, covering one-half or more of the tail; primaries ten,
the first more than one-half and less than two-thirds of second,
the latter shorter than third and equal to sixth; the fourth longest;
rectrices well developed, tail slightly rounded.

Adult male.--Bright golden yellow and black; forehead and part of
crown yellow; lores, a wide space about eye continued with a broad band
across crown and occiput black, forming a broad crescent-shaped mark;
wings black, some of the primaries narrowly edged with gray; tertials
tipped with yellow; secondary-coverts, axillars, wing-lining, and
edge of wing bright yellow; rectrices black, tipped with yellow, the
yellow tip narrowest on the central pair and gradually wider on each
succeeding pair to the outermost; entire under parts bright yellow,
not so deep as the back. Iris pale pink; bill pinkish flesh-color;
legs plumbeous; nails horn-color. An adult male from Luzon measures:
Length, 305; wing, 150; tail, 104; culmen from base, 34; bill from
nostril, 24; tarsus, 25.

Adult female.--Similar to the male, but the mantle with a dusky,
slightly olive, wash contrasting strongly with the clear golden yellow
of hind neck. A female from Mindoro measures: Wing, 149; tail, 112;
culmen from base, 34; bill from nostril, 25; tarsus, 26.

Young.--Above olive-yellow or golden olive; the crescent crown mark
obscure and more or less dusky olive in color; tertials and rectrices
dusky, washed with olive; under parts much paler than in the adult,
near lemon- or gamboge-yellow; feathers of breast with distinct black
shaft-lines. As the bird becomes older the crescent-mark on the head
becomes better developed and the shaft-marks on the breast become
less distinct. The bill is dusky brown in immature individuals.

Three eggs of the Philippine oriole, taken by Whitehead at Cape Engaño,
Luzon, on April 15, 1895, are thus described:

"Shape ovate. Pure white, with scattered spots and minute dots
of deep blackish brown, and a few faint under-markings of slate
gray. Measurements 32 mm. by 23 mm." Two eggs from Fuga, April 5,
1895, are "similar to the above." Measurements 33 mm. by 22 mm.

"The first nest was placed in a casuarina tree on the seacoast at some
distance from the forest; the second was found in a high tree close
to the freshly made nest of the white-breasted sea eagle (Haliætus
leucogaster) from which the bird was disturbed. Both nests were of
the usually oriole type." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"After a careful comparison of specimens from Palawan and the
Calamianes Islands, we can see no good reason for making distinct
species of them. The amount of yellow on the head is extremely
variable. We have birds from Luzon and Mindoro which show quite as
much as any of our Palawan or Calamianes birds. Nor do we find any
constant difference in size between the Palawan-Calamianes birds and
those from other parts of the group.

"Nine males average: Length, 290; wing, 155; tail, 107; culmen,
37; tarsus, 25; middle toe with claw, 28.7. Five females, length,
280; wing, 149; tail, 105; culmen, 36; tarsus, 25; middle toe with
claw, 28.4. Iris brown; legs and feet dull black; bill pinkish,
white along gape and at tip. One of the commonest Philippine birds,
found abundantly among the coconut groves and in the scattered trees
about open fields, and not infrequently met with in the forest as
well. Variously called 'antu-li-hao', 'tu-li-hao', 'tu-li-hi-ao', and
'ku-li-ao-an' by the natives, in attempted imitation of its rather
musical note." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1898), 20, 558, no. 305; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 107.

    Masbate (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester); Negros (Steere, Keay,
    Whitehead, Celestino).


Male.--Above olive-yellow; slightly darker on head, and brighter,
more golden, on rump and tail-coverts; chin, throat, and chest dark
ashy gray; lower breast and abdomen whitish, each feather with a
broad median black streak; thighs black, mottled with white; under
tail-coverts bright lemon-yellow with dusky shaft-lines; primaries,
outer secondaries, primary-coverts, and alula-feathers blackish,
edged with ashy gray; inner webs of primaries edged with white;
secondary-coverts and inner secondaries edged with dark olive-yellow;
rectrices blackish, the outermost pair each with a large yellow spot
(about 18 mm. in length) at tip of inner web, the spot gradually
decreasing in size on each succeeding feather. A male from northern
Negros measures: Wing, 122; tail, 86; culmen from base, 24; tarsus, 21.

Female.--The female resembles the male in colors, but is slightly
smaller and has a smaller yellow spot on the outermost rectrix. A
female from northern Negros measures: Wing, 111; tail, 78; culmen
from base, 23.5; tarsus, 21.

Steere's oriole differs from the Basilan oriole in having the inner
webs of the primaries white and the yellow spots on the rectrices
much larger.



712. ORIOLUS BASILANICUS Grant.

BASILAN ORIOLE.

    Oriolus steerei McGregor, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A,
    290 (Basilan).

    Basilan (Steere, Everett, Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester,
    McGregor); Mindanao (Platen, Bourns & Worcester).


Adult.--Similar to Oriolus steeri of Negros from which it differs in
having the lores, chin, throat, and chest lighter gray and the black
stripes of lower breast and abdomen narrower; inner webs of quills
edged with pale yellow instead of with white; the yellow spots on
inner webs of rectrices much smaller. Iris red; bill reddish brown;
feet dark plumbeous. A male measures: Length, 200; wing, 111; tail,
69; culmen from base, 22.5; bill from nostril, 16; tarsus, 21. A
female measures: Length, 195; wing, 106; tail, 68; culmen from base,
22; bill from nostril, 16; tarsus, 20.

Young.--Like the adult but chin, throat, and chest white, streaked
with gray or black. Iris gray with very little mixture of red; bill
dark brown.

"Had we known the habits of the orioles of this type as well at the
beginning of our trip as we did at its close, we should doubtless
have done more than we did to extend their known distribution within
the Philippines. The peculiar note which they utter at frequent
intervals when feeding is absolutely unmistakable, and can be heard
for a considerable distance. They feed for the most part in the tops
of high trees, seldom coming down into the second growth. They can,
however, be readily called by imitating their note.

"Eleven males average: Length, 192; wing, 111; tail, 71; culmen,
23.8; tarsus, 21; middle toe with claw, 23. Five females, length, 182;
wing, 105; tail, 71; culmen, 23.6; tarsus, 20; middle toe with claw,
22. Iris varies from gray to brown and red; legs and feet dark drab,
nails black; bill light reddish brown." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



713. ORIOLUS CINEREOGENYS Bourns and Worcester.

GRAY-CHEEKED ORIOLE.


    Oriolus cinereogenys Bourns and Worcester,
    Minnesota Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers (1894), 1, 16;
    Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1898), 20, 558, no. 304 (Tawi Tawi and
    Bongao).

    Bongao (Everett); Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester, Everett).


"In uniting the Tawi Tawi birds with O. steerii [basilanicus] from
Basilan and Mindanao, Dr. Sharpe has evidently overlooked the fact that
the Tawi Tawi birds invariably have the cheeks and ear-coverts clear
ashy gray, while in birds from Basilan and Mindanao they are just as
invariably olive-green. As we find no exception to this rule among our
fourteen specimens from Basilan and twenty from Tawi Tawi we have no
hesitation in separating the birds from the latter locality. It may
be added that the rump of the Tawi Tawi birds is rather brighter,
and the throat decidedly lighter than in Basilan birds. Not one
of our Tawi Tawi birds shows the uniform gray throat of O. steerii
[basilanicus]. Both species show great variability in the color of
under tail-coverts. In some specimens they are pure yellow and in
others heavily streaked with black. Fifteen males from Tawi Tawi
measure as follows: Length, 203; culmen, 24.3; wing, 116.5; tail,
81; tarsus, 21." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Four females average: Length, 200; wing, 111; tail, 76; culmen,
23.3; tarsus, 21; middle toe with claw, 21.8. Eyes usually reddish
brown, but in two cases gray; legs and feet dark drab; bill reddish
brown usually, in two cases black. Very common near Tataan, in Tawi
Tawi." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



714. ORIOLUS ASSIMILIS Tweeddale.

CEBU ORIOLE.


    Oriolus assimilis Tweeddale, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1877), 760,
    pl. 76; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 107; McGregor,
    Phil. Jour. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A, 308.

    Cebu (Everett, Bourns & Worcester, McGregor).


Adult (sexes similar).--Above olive-yellow; lores, jaw, cheeks,
chin, throat, and chest cinereous; lower breast, abdomen, flanks,
and thighs white heavily streaked with black; feathers of crissum
dark olive-green, edged with olive-yellow; rectrices black slightly
washed with olive basally, narrowly tipped with dark gray on both
webs and with light yellow on inner webs; inner webs of wing-quills
edged with pale gray; axillars and wing-lining cinereous; bend of
wing gray, washed with yellow. Iris bright red; bill dull red-brown;
feet lead-blue; nails black. In the immature bird the iris is white
and the bill dull brown. An adult male measures: Length, 234; wing,
122; tail, 94; culmen from base, 24; bill from nostril, 16.5; tarsus,
22. Adult female, wing, 116; tail, 86; culmen from base, 24; bill
from nostril, 16.5; tarsus, 22.

"While this species is plainly of the Oriolus steeri type it differs
in being larger, in the much darker and greener upper parts and under
tail-coverts, in the darker throat and breast, in the wider black
markings of abdomen, and in the reduced yellow tips of rectrices.

"O. assimilis is exceedingly common in the small amount of forest
left in Cebu. It is a well-marked species and could not possibly
be mistaken for O. steeri, being a much darker bird. The lack of
the bright rump and under tail-coverts is an especially striking
point of difference. Sixteen males average: Length, 225; wing, 120;
tail, 89; culmen, 26; tarsus, 22.3; middle toe with claw, 23.8. Ten
females, length, 217; wing, 118; tail, 87; culmen, 25.6; tarsus,
22.3; middle toe with claw, 23.3. Iris usually bright red, but in
one case gray; legs and feet dark drab, nails black; bill light to
dark reddish brown. Food worms, grubs, snails, and fruit." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

to a mere trace on the middle pair; shafts of rectrices black above,
brown below. A male measures: Wing, 111; tail, 75; culmen from base,
23; bill from nostril, 16; tarsus, 20.

Female.--Head, neck, sides of neck and ear-coverts black, streaked with
olive-green; back yellow, but not so bright as in the male; jaw, chin,
throat, and chest cinereous with whitish streaks; breast and abdomen
like the male, but less heavily streaked with black; primaries more
widely edged with pale gray than in the male; secondaries and tertials
broadly edged with olive-green; primary-coverts and alula edged with
gray; exposed edges of all the secondary-coverts olive-green; rectrices
heavily washed with olive-green on outer webs; both webs of central
pair nearly all olive-green; shafts yellow below. A female measures:

wing, 106; tail, 73; culmen, 23; tarsus, 20.5; middle toe with claw,
21.5. Iris deep red; legs and feet slaty blue, nails blackish; bill
light reddish brown." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    [101] (Steere Exp., Schmacker, Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead,
    McGregor, Mearns); Polillo (McGregor); Verde (McGregor.)


Adult (sexes alike).--Black, the exposed edges of the feathers glossed
with steel-green which changes to dark purple in some lights; lores
velvety black; feathers of throat and chest somewhat lanceolate;
feathers of sides and flanks white or light gray basally; wing-lining
and axillars glossy steel-blue. A male from Lubang Island measures:
Length, 267; wing, 145; tail, 126; bill from nostril, 20; depth of
bill at nostril, 10; tarsus, 23. A female from Bataan Province, Luzon,
measures: Wing, 141; tail, 118; bill from nostril, 21; depth of bill
at nostril, 11; tarsus, 24.

"The Philippine representatives of this genus are all bold, impudent
birds, and invariably appear when there is any disturbance in the
woods. If picked up when wounded they bite and scratch viciously. They
all feed exclusively on insects so far as our observation goes. Three
male birds from Mindoro measure as follows: Wing, 138; tail, 113;
culmen, 32; tarsus, 23; middle toe with claw, 24. Three females from
Luzon, wing, 131; tail, 116.5; culmen, 31; tarsus, 23; middle toe

Adult.--Similar to Dicrurus balicassius, but mantle, back, and
rump velvety blue-black with a very slight gloss; feathers of crown
scale-like and glossy; long lanceolate feathers on sides of neck dark
glossy green; under parts blue-black; throat and chest spangled with
glossy steel-blue. A male from Bohol measures: Wing, 134; tail, 103;
depth of fork, 6; bill from nostril, 22; depth of bill at nostril,
10; tarsus, 22. A female from Basilan, wing, 135; tail, 112; bill
from nostril, 21; depth of bill at nostril, 10; tarsus, 21.

In general appearance the southern drongo resembles a Chibia, but
the tail is even less forked than in D. balicassius.

This species was very abundant near Isabela, Basilan. A female, taken
January 15, differs from the usual specimens in having the feathers
of lower breast and abdomen tipped with gray. A pensile nest of this
species, found on March 12, is composed of plant fibers. Its inside
diameter is 76 mm. and its inside depth is 50 mm. The three eggs are
light cream, almost white, in color, decorated with faint spots of pale
lilac and brighter spots of reddish brown, mostly near the larger end
of the egg. The eggs measure: 28.9 by 19.3; 29.2 by 19; 29.4 by 19.5.

"Habits like those of D. balicassius. Abundant in Mindanao and
Basilan. Two males from the latter island average: Length, 250; wing,
130; tail, 116; culmen, 32; tarsus, 22; middle toe with claw, 23. Three
females, length, 250; tail, 113; wing, 132; culmen, 34; tarsus, 21;
middle toe with claw, 23.6. Iris, legs, feet, and nails black; bill
black, except tip of lower mandible, which is often white." (Bourns
and Worcester MS.)

    and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 107.

    Lapoc, off Siasi (Bartsch); Sulu (Guillemard, Bourns & Worcester).


"The Sulu form differs from the Sula bird in smaller size
(wings and tail) and somewhat smaller glossy spangles on the
breast and from D. borneensis in having a larger bill and longer
tail." (Hartert.) Measurements of this species are given as follows:
"Wing, 145 to 155; tail, 133 to 136; bill, 34 to 36."

    Ticao (McGregor).


Adult (sexes alike).--Black, glossed with steel-green like
D. balicassius, but lower breast, abdomen, and crissum pure white. A
male from Ticao Island measures: Length, 280; wing, 142; tail, 121;
bill from nostril, 23; depth of bill at nostril, 11.5; tarsus, 13. A
female from the same island, wing, 137; tail, 120; bill from nostril,
21; depth of bill at nostril, 11; tarsus, 24.

"Bourns thought that he saw an individual of this species in Siquijor
on one occasion, but he failed to secure it, and it was not again met
with in the island. If it occurs there, it must be very rare. It is
rather more shy than the other Philippine representatives of the genus.

"Four males from Cebu average: Length, 260; wing, 137; tail, 117;
culmen, 33; tarsus, 23; middle toe with claw, 25. Five females,
length, 260; wing, 137; tail, 119; culmen, 33; tarsus, 23; middle
toe with claw, 25. Specimens from other localities agree closely in
dimensions with the above. Bill, legs, feet, and nails black. Food
insects. Breeding in June and July." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus CHIBIA Hodgson, 1836.

9. A female, wing, 145; tail, 124; bill from nostril, 11.5; tarsus, 27.

This species differs from C. palawanensis in being larger and in
having the bill longer and deeper; spangles on chest larger.



722. CHIBIA WORCESTERI McGregor.

WORCESTER'S DRONGO.


    Chibia worcesteri McGregor, Bur. Govt. Laboratories (1905), 34,
    26; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 107.

    Semirara (Worcester).


Male.--Similar to Chibia cuyensis and to C. palawanensis, but with
the outermost rectrices more recurved than in either of these;
wing longer than in C. cuyensis; bill longer and deeper than in
C. palawanensis. The type and only specimen measures: Length, 292;
wing, 150; tail, 136; bill from nostril, 22; depth of bill at nostril,
11; tarsus, 24; difference in length between the middle and outermost
rectrices, 20.



723. CHIBIA BORNEENSIS Sharpe.

BORNEAN DRONGO.


    Chibia borneensis Sharpe, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1879), 246; Worcester
    and Bourns, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. Wash. (1898), 20, 558, no. 298;
    McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 107.
    Chibia pectoralis Guillemard, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1885), 259, 418.
    Chibia cagayanensis Mearns, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1909), 36,
    447. [102]

    Bongao (Everett); Cagayan Sulu (Guillemard, Mearns); Sibutu
    (Everett); Tawi Tawi (Bourns & Worcester). Borneo.


Similar to C. pectoralis (Sula Island), "but it may be recognized on
comparison by the much smaller and more metallic spots on the throat
and fore neck, which are steel-green, as also are the neck-hackles. In
C. pectoralis the spangles are large, dull, and inclined to purplish
in tint. This species appears to me to be a thorough Chibia. * *
 *." (Sharpe.)

"The young bird from Kina Balu differs from the adult in being
duller black, with fewer and less metallic chest-spots and
hackles." (Sharpe.) [103]

"Guillemard thought his Cagayan Sulu specimens to be of the same
species with those from Sulu, though he mentions the lack of frontal
plumes in the former. Dr. Sharpe has shown that the Sulu-Tawi Tawi
birds must be referred to C. borneensis, and if Guillemard was right
in believing the Cagayan Sulu birds to be identical with those from
Sulu, C. pectoralis must be excluded from the list of Philippine birds.

"Five males from Sulu average: Length, 284; wing, 150; tail, 132;
culmen, 35; tarsus, 24; middle toe with claw, 26. Eight females,
length, 273; wing, 149; tail, 123; culmen, 32.5; tarsus, 23; middle
toe with claw, 24. Iris chocolate-brown to dark red; bill, legs,
feet, and nails black. Food insects." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



724. CHIBIA MENAGEI Bourns and Worcester.

MENAGE'S DRONGO.


    Chibia menagei Bourns and Worcester, Minnesota
    Acad. Nat. Sci. Occ. Papers (1894), 1, 15; McGregor and Worcester,
    Hand-List (1906), 107; McGregor, Phil. Jour. Sci. (1906), 1, 775,
    pl. 4.

    Tablas (Bourns and Worcester, Celestino).


Adult.--Very similar in colors to C. palawanensis, but distinguished
from that and all other Philippine species of the genus by the
extremely long and very deeply forked tail. A male in worn plumage
measures: Length, 355; wing, 141; tail (chord of longest feather),
187; bill from nostril, 22.5; depth of bill at nostril, 11; tarsus,
25; difference in length between the middle and outermost rectrices,
73; distance between tips of outermost rectrices, 120.

"Average measurements of nine males: Length, 336; culmen, 34.7; wing,
137; tail, 175; tarsus, 25. Of seven females: Length, 327; culmen,
34.7; wing, 136; tail, 168; tarsus, 26. This curious species is by
far the largest representative of its genus yet discovered in the
Philippine Islands, and differs strikingly from both the other known
species, one of which is confined to Palawan and the Calamianes
Islands, while the other occurs in the Sulu Group and in Cagayan
Sulu. C. menagei seems to be strictly confined to the Island of Tablas
where it is not rare in the deep woods." (Bourns and Worcester.)

"Iris very dark brown; bill, legs, feet and nails black. Food
insects." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



Genus BHUCHANGA Hodgson, 1836.

Tail deeply forked and slightly shorter than wing; rectrices much
narrower than in either Dicrurus or Chibia, the outermost pair slightly
upturned at tips. Prevailing colors of plumage blue-gray and cinereous.



725. BHUCHANGA PALAWANENSIS Whitehead.

PALAWAN GRAY DRONGO.


    Buchanga leucophæa Sharpe, Ibis (1888), 199.
    Buchanga palawanensis Whitehead, Ibis (1893), 47; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 108.
    Dicrurus leucophæus var. whiteheadi Durbois, Syn. Av. (1901),
    fasc. 8, 530, no. 1772.

    Balabac (Everett); Calamianes (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor);
    Palawan (Steere, Everett, Lempriere, Platen, Whitehead, Steere
    Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino, White).


Adult.-Upper parts blue-gray with a slight gloss on head and back;
forehead and lores black; cheeks and ear-coverts blackish; chin and
throat cinereous becoming somewhat bluer on the breast and abdomen;
under tail-coverts tipped with white; wings and tail blackish brown,
but the exposed edges of most of the feathers cinereous; axillars
and wing-lining blue-gray. A male from Palawan measures: Length, 354;
wing, 124; tail, 120; depth of fork, 26; bill from nostril, 17; tarsus,
17. A female, wing, 125; tail, 123; bill from nostril, 17; tarsus, 15.

"We adopt Whitehead's title for this bird with some hesitation. He
states that it differs from B. leucophæa in its smaller size,
darker color, and in having a jet-black patch of feathers over the
nostrils. He adds that the eye in B. leucophæa is brick-red, and in
B. palawanensis dark gray. As regards the latter point Whitehead is
certainly in error. On examining the labels of the twenty specimens
collected by us in Palawan and the Calamianes Islands we find that the
iris was red or brick-red in nineteen cases and reddish brown in the
twentieth. The difference in color could be verified only by actual
comparison for which we have not the necessary material. We add full
measurements, hoping that they may be of use to some one in settling
the question of the relative size of the two alleged species. Four
males average: Length, 267; wing, 129; tail, 127; culmen, 26; tarsus,
17; middle toe with claw, 18.5. Eight females, length, 251; wing,
125; tail, 126; culmen, 25; tarsus, 17.5; middle toe with claw,
19. Iris brick-red; bill, legs, feet, and nails black." (Bourns and
Worcester MS.)



Family STURNIDÆ.

Bill stout and pointed; culmen curved or nearly straight; rictal
bristles minute when present; nostrils exposed, or else concealed by
antrorse frontal plumes; wing either moderate or long, primaries much
longer than secondaries; first primary shorter than primary-coverts;
second primary nearly, or quite, as long as the third; tail square,
or else the rectrices graduated; tarsus stout, distinctly scutellate
in front and bilaminate behind.



Subfamily STURNINÆ.

The arrangement of the genera here placed in the subfamily Sturninæ
is far from satisfactory. Oates, Fauna of British India, Birds (1889),
1, 509, has established the family Eulabetidæ for the reception of two
of these genera, Eulabes and Calornis (=Lamprocorax), and at the same
time says: "Probably Eulabes should not be associated with Calornis,
but rather with the subfamily Sibiinæ of the Crateropodidæ." It is
true that Eulabes and Calornis, as well as Sarcops and Goodfellowia,
present some well-marked differences from typical starlings, such as
the members of Sturnia, and some rearrangement of these genera may
become necessary.

feet orange; iris black, with a light circle.' (David.) Length, 198;
culmen, 25; wing, 120; tail, 61; tarsus, 29.

"All the males [in the British Museum], so marked, are of a delicate

head. A female collected by Mr. Reeves at Ningpo is altogether browner,
rather more ashy on the rump; the gloss on the wings and tail less
distinct; primary-coverts blackish brown near the base, white at the
ends, with a central black streak; head whitish, ashy gray on sides
of crown and hind neck; sides of face whitish, ashy on the cheeks;

white, streaked with black; chin and throat dark ashy brown with
paler and indistinct shaft-streaks; breast ashy, slightly paler than
throat; sides of the body and thighs rufous ashy; abdomen and under
tail-coverts white; back, scapulars, rump, and upper tail-coverts
drab-brown with a broad white bar across the rump; tail drab-brown

wing blackish, the primaries narrowly, the secondaries more broadly,
margined with white on the outer webs; under wing-coverts and axillars
white, a few feathers of the former partially margined with brown.

"The youngest bird I have seen has the whole plumage russet-brown,
the inner webs of the tail-feathers tipped with white, the quills of
the wing edged with paler brown; the ear-coverts whitish; the chin
nearly pure white.

"Between this young bird and the adult above described there is every
possible gradation of plumage. The nestling is probably streaked below.

of the lower mandible and the angle of the mantle brownish green;
legs yellow.' (David and Oustalet.) Length, about 229; tail, 71;
wing, 132; tarsus, 32; bill from gape, 33." (Oates.)

The gray starling is known as a member of the Philippine ornis from
a single specimen collected in northern Luzon by Doctor Mearns. This
specimen has the chin, throat, and crest mottled with white and there
is much white on the forehead and sides of head.

    Kohl-leé-po, Bagobos of Todaya.

    Mindanao (Mearns, Goodfellow).


Female (type).--"Similar to L. panayensis, but much smaller,
and otherwise differing as follows: The feathers of the nape
and lower throat are more rigid and, perhaps, relatively longer;
viewed in certain lights the plumage is less golden green, the gloss
being purplish blue; the wings and tail are dull, purplish black,
without metallic gloss; and the throat is more decidedly glossed
with violet-purple. Length of skin, 157; wing, 95; tail, 59; culmen,
13.5; bill from nostril, 10; depth of bill at nostrils, 6; tarsus,
19." (Mearns.) "Iris ruby-red; bill and feet black." (Goodfellow.)

"This small species of glossy starling was abundant in the high forest
above the Bagobo village of Todaya, where small flocks flew with great
speed above the treetops, only alighting on the highest dry branches,
where they were with difficulty reached by shot." (Mearns.)



Genus ÆTHEOPSAR Sharpe, 1890.

Frontal and nasal feathers long, antrorse or erect, and concealing
the nostrils; feathers of crown, occiput, and ear-coverts lanceolate;
tail short and rounded; plumage nearly all black or slate-gray;
tips of primary-coverts and a large section of primaries pure white,
forming a conspicuous wing-bar.

    (McGregor).


Adult.--Differs from Sarcops calvus only in having the back black
forming a distinct dark area between the silvery gray of the hind
neck in front and of the rump and tail-coverts behind.

Until recently Sarcops has been considered to be a monotypic genus. It
is true that in 1877 Sharpe described Sarcops lowii from Sibutu,
but as the type of this species remains unique we may consider its
status to be at least doubtful. In 1895 Grant called attention to
some differences between specimens of bald starlings collected in
localities east of the meridian 122 and those from localities west
of that line. Quoting in part from Grant: "we find that east of
longitude 122 degrees, or thereabout, all the Philippine examples
of S. calvus have the mantle and upper back brownish black; while
west of this line all have the upper parts uniform silvery gray;
intermediate forms being met with only in localities situated along
the line where the two forms intergrade."

In 1906 Grant designated the eastern race as Sarcops melanonotus which
is here recognized. The difference between the two races, while evident
enough in extreme examples, is not always well marked. As Grant states,
specimens taken near the meridian 122 are usually intermediate in the
color of the mantle and are not satisfactorily referable to either
race. These intermediate birds occur in Basilan, Bohol, Marinduque,
Luzon, Tablas, Bohol, and Cebu. In Luzon and Bohol, at least, both
varieties and intermediate specimens have been found.

Under these conditions it will be understood that the distribution of
the two races of Sarcops, as indicated by islands, is only tentative,
while the assignment of the various collectors to their proper places
is more or less a matter of guesswork.



Genus GOODFELLOWIA Hartert, 1903.

Bill shorter than head; nostrils overhung by antrorse frontal plumes;
bare space around each eye much smaller than in Sarcops; a long crest
of decomposed feathers springing from the crown; tail much longer than
wing; rectrices graduated; plumage black, glossed with steel-green;
a large white patch on rump.

    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 108.

    Tu-ca-ling', Bagobo of Mount Apo.

    Mindanao (Goodfellow, Mearns).


Adult (sexes alike).--Black, glossed with dark green; wings and
tail blackish brown with little or no gloss; wing-lining and
a large patch on lower back and rump white. "Iris dark brown,
bare skin round eye yellow; bill yellow, shading into greenish
yellow at the base; toes dirty olive or blackish olive; legs
olive-yellow." (Goodfellow.) Length, about 300 mm. A male measures:

difference between longest and shortest rectrices, 90. A female,
wing, 114; tail, 162; culmen from base, 25; tarsus, 30; crest, 25;
difference between longest and shortest rectrices, 92.

This peculiar starling is confined to the highlands of Mindanao.



Genus EULABES Cuvier, 1817.

Bill shorter than head and very stout; culmen strongly curved; nasal
feathers antrorse, but short and not concealing the nostrils; feathers
on head very short, those of lores and a broad band of feathers on
each side of crown and occiput pile-like; a bare space below each
eye; a bare space behind each eye ending in a fleshy flap, or wattle,

    (Steere, Everett, Lempriere, Whitehead, Platen, Steere Exp.,
    Bourns & Worcester, Celestino, White).


Adult (sexes alike).--Black, most of the plumage with a slight green
gloss, but the gloss slightly bluish on throat, breast, and hind-neck,
purplish on mantle; second to seventh primaries with a wide white band,
but on the second confined to the inner web and sometimes indicated
by a small white spot on the outer web of the eighth. A male from
Palawan measures: Wing, 162; tail, 75; culmen from base, 30; bill
from nostril, 19; tarsus, 36. A female from the same locality, wing,
168; tail, 74; culmen from base, 32; bill from nostril, 21; tarsus, 36.

"This wattled myna is common in Palawan and extremely abundant in
the Calamianes Islands. It is a very noisy bird, and some of its
cries are astonishingly human. Iris very dark brown; legs and feet
bright yellow; nails yellow at base, white at tip; bill orange-red,
yellow at tip; bare flesh of head bright yellow. Five males from
the Calamianes average: Length, 281; wing, 106; tail, 77; tarsus,
34; middle toe with claw, 36. Four females from the same locality,
length, 273; tail, 73; culmen, 30; tarsus, 33; middle toe with claw,

Adult.--Entirely black, the feathers white basally; feathers, of neck
at least, more white than black; upper parts including greater part of
wing glossed with purple; alula and primary-coverts glossed with dark
green; two outer primaries without gloss; under parts with a slight
bluish gloss. Length, about 500 mm. A male from Siquijor measures:
Wing, 325; tail, 230; culmen from base, 65; bill from nostril, 47;
tarsus, 52. A female from Bohol, wing, 300; tail, 220; culmen from
base, 60; bill from nostril, 41; tarsus, 48.

Three eggs of the Philippine crow collected by Steere in Marinduque,
May, 1888, are thus described: "Shape ovate. Ground-color pale
sea-green, thickly mottled all over, especially towards the larger
end, with olive-brown; under-markings faint gray. Measurements 43
mm. by 28 mm. The nest is a loosely constructed platform of fiber,
mixed with a few rootlets, etc." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"The Philippine crow is very common throughout the Islands, except in
the Palawan group, where it is lacking. It picks into young coconuts,
steals young pigeons, and even comes into the kitchens of the native
houses to steal. As a natural consequence, the bird is thoroughly
detested. Two males measure: Length, 546; wing, 314; tail, 210; culmen,
59; tarsus, 54; middle toe with claw, 52." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)

    Balabac (Everett); Calamianes (Bourns & Worcester, McGregor);
    Mindoro (Steere Exp., Schmacker, Bourns & Worcester, Whitehead,
    McGregor); Palawan (Everett, Lempriere, Whitehead, Platen, Steere
    Exp., Bourns & Worcester, Celestino, White).


Adult.--Entirely black, faintly glossed with purple; bases of many
of the feathers drab-gray or white; gloss on alula, primaries, and
primary-coverts dark green. A male from Mindoro measures: Wing, 250;
tail, 135; culmen from base, 50; bill from nostril, 37; depth of bill
at nostril, 18; tarsus, 44. A female from Mindoro, wing, 240; tail,
145; culmen from base, 50; tarsus, 46.

Steere collected a single egg of this species in Mindoro in June,
1888. The egg, taken from the oviduct of female, is thus described:
"Shape ovate, rather rounded towards the smaller end. Ground-color
pale greenish white, finely spotted and dotted over the entire shell
with greenish brown and pale lavender. Measurements 38 mm. by 26
mm." (Grant and Whitehead.)

"The little crow is very common in Mindoro; much rarer in Palawan
and the Calamianes Islands. Unlike Corone philippina, it is a very
shy bird. Its note sounds like that of an overgrown 'katy-did.' Iris
dark brown; legs, feet, nails, and bill black. A male from Culion
measures, 381 in length; wing, 243; tail, 136; culmen, 50; tarsus,
46; middle toe with claw, 45. A female from Palawan, length, 368;
wing, 237; tail, 137; culmen, 47; tarsus, 39; middle toe with claw,
43." (Bourns and Worcester MS.)



739. CORVUS SAMARENSIS Steere.

SAMAR CROW.



    Corvus samarensis Steere, List Birds & Mams. Steere Exped. (1890),
    23; McGregor and Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 110.

    Mindanao (Celestino); Samar (Steere Exp., Bourns & Worcester).


Adult.--In color the same as Corvus pusillus, but smaller in size;
bill somewhat shorter and deeper. A female from northern Mindanao
measures: Length, 340; wing, 220; tail, 120; culmen from base, 47.5;
bill from nostril, 34; depth of bill at nostril, 18; tarsus, 38.

"The Samar crow has the shy habits of C. pusillus, but its note
is entirely different. We heard its note for a long time without
suspecting that it was made by a crow. We occasionally found
C. pusillus about the open fields, but never met with C. samarensis
except on the sides of well-wooded hills. A male measures: Length,
355; wing, 252; tail, 116; culmen, 52; tarsus, 35; middle toe with
claw, 45. Three females average: Length, 338; wing, 215; tail, 118;
culmen, 48; tarsus, 46; middle toe with claw, 44. Iris dark brown:
legs, feet, nails, and bill black. Food fruit and insects." (Bourns

SAMAR WHITE-EARED PIGEON.


    Phapitreron samarensis Mearns, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1909),
    36, 436.


"Characters.--Resembling Phapitreron brevirostris, but with
forehead, chin, and throat whiter than in P. albifrons McGregor. From
P. brevirostris it is readily distinguishable by the white forehead,
chin, and upper throat, also by the much greater amount of coppery
amethystine reflections on the crown, breast, and upper back, and
by the usual absence of green reflections on the side of the hind
head below the suborbital white stripe; and the under parts are
much paler. From P. albifrons it may be at once distinguished by the
different color of the under parts, which lack the olivaceous-gray
on the breast, and by its more ochraceous abdomen; also the coppery
reflections on the breast and upper back of P. samarensis are entirely
absent in P. albifrons.

"Measurements of type (from well-made skin of female).--Total length,
230 mm.; wing, 124; tail, 95; culmen and cere (chord), 14; tarsus,

MUSCADIVORES PALMASENSIS Mearns.

PALMAS ISLAND IMPERIAL PIGEON.


    Muscadivores palmasensis Mearns, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1909),
    36, 436.


"Characters.--Closely related to Muscadivores pickeringi from
Mangsee Island, north of Borneo, on the west side of the Sulu Sea;
also to Muscadivores langhornei Mearns, from West Bolod Island,
southeast of the Sulu Sea and near the Island of Basilan. From the
type of pickeringi (Cat. No. 15,732 U. S. N. M.) it differs in being
paler, with much less vinaceous color on the chin, throat, breast,
and under tail-coverts. The wing is 10 mm. shorter. From langhornei,
which it resembles more closely in the coloration of the under parts,
it can be distinguished at a glance by the dark color of the mantle,
rump, and upper tail-coverts.

"Adult male (type, killed January 21).--Head, neck, upper back, and
upper parts, lilac-gray, purest on the upper side of the neck and
upper back, washed with vinaceous on crown, ear-coverts, and breast,
fading to whitish around base of bill, and shading to drab-gray on
legs and crissum; scapulars, back, rump, and wing-coverts mouse-gray,
lustrous in a certain light; wing-quills and upper tail-coverts dark
mouse-gray, with subdued reflections of violet, coppery, and green;
rectrices lustrous golden green above, smoke-gray below; flanks,
axillars, and lining of wings clear gray. An adult male topotype
in fresh plumage, shot by Dr. Paul C. Freer, October 7, 1906, only
differs from the type in being appreciably darker. The sexes are
practically alike in size and color.

"Colors of soft parts.--Two mated pairs, about to breed, had the soft
parts colored exactly alike, January 21, 1906: Iris red; eyelids and
feet vinaceous; claws dusky purplish gray; bare space surrounding
eye, pale plumbeous; bill pale bluish gray at tip, darker plumbeous
at base. Testicles functionally enlarged.

"Measurements of two adult males (type and topotype measured fresh
by the author).--Total length, 420, 430 mm.; alar expanse, 735, 750;
wing, 240, 240; tail, 156, 160; culmen (chord), 20, 20; tarsus, 32,

    Otus steerei Mearns, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1909), 36,
    437. Tumindao, off Sitanki (Mearns).


"Characters.--Very similar to the Celebesian Otus menadensis, from
which it may be distinguished by being larger, with upper parts darker,
with more of the black vermiculations; black centers to the feathers
of the under parts much less conspicuous; feathers of tarsus more
heavily cross-barred with blackish. Of the Philippine species it
is most closely related to Otus cuyensis McGregor, but is darker
and much smaller, having the same white, black-tipped scapulars,
but with the entire plumage darker and more heavily marked, and
the wing 15 mm. shorter. It bears no close resemblance to any other
Philippine species.

"Measurements.--Wing, 157 mm.; tail, 84; culmen from cere (chord),
15; tarsus, 33. Iris yellow; bill and feet greenish (from fresh
specimen). The stomach of the type contained insects." (Mearns.)

"Characters.--Closely related to Prioniturus waterstradti
Rothschild, from Mount Apo, southeastern Mindanao, from which it
may be distinguished by its larger size, much yellower coloring of
under side, greener, less brownish back and scapulars, longer tail,
but much shorter naked shafts to the central pair of feathers.

"Adult female (type and only specimen).--Upper parts green, with
slight touches of bluish on forehead, and a light greenish brown rump,
as in P. waterstradti; wings bright green above, with concealed inner
webs blackish, and outer webs narrowly edged with yellow; edge of wing
yellow; rectrices green above tipped with dull black, beryl-green on
under side, the shafts and spatules of the central pair dull black,
with webs all green to the naked shafts; entire under parts golden
green; axillars and lining of wings oil-green; under side of primaries
dull black, broadly bordered on the inner webs with beryl-green. Iris
dark brown; bill pale horn-color, faintly plumbeous at base and tip
of mandibles; feet and claws plumbeous (from fresh specimen).

"Adult male (type).--Similar to the male of Y. ramsayi, but with a
smaller bill and without white markings on the upper surface of the
primaries or secondaries except a small concealed white spot on inner
webs of several secondaries, and with much less white on the inner
margins of the inner webs on under side of wing; and the orange-yellow
of the under parts is much more restricted, being confined to a narrow
band across the chest.

"Adult female ( * * * ).--Similar to the male, but lacking the
elongated scarlet feathers on the edge of the posterior half of the
crown and occiput, the entire upper surface of head and neck being dark
brown. The white markings of the upper and under sides of the wings are
restricted to the same extent as those of the type, and tend to form a
very narrow brownish white margin to the inner webs of the innermost
secondaries, below, instead of forming squarish detached white spots

"Compared with the Samar and Mindanao forms the Basilan form,
Rhinomyias ruficauda ruficauda, has the under parts whiter, middle of
chest grayer, sides of chest and flanks a grayer brown, with entire
side of head slate-gray.

A recently described subspecies of stork-billed kingfisher is based
upon a male collected by Bartsch in the Island of Masbate. The
citation is:


    Rhamphalcyon capensis smithi Mearns, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. (1909)
    36, 466.


This subspecies is said to be intermediate in color between Pelargopsis
gouldi and P. gigantea and larger than either of them. The type
measures: "Wing, 157 mm.; tail, 96; exposed culmen, 80; tarsus, 17."

I regret that a copy of the fifth and final volume of Sharpe's

[4] It is a matter of difficulty to distinguish between the soft short
tail-feathers and the long, overhanging coverts; in this species,
therefore, it is more convenient to measure from base of tail to tip
of longest covert.

[5] The status of Gallus stramineicollis, described from a specimen
collected in Sulu by Burbidge, is somewhat doubtful; Grant considers
it a domestic bird. The original description follows:

"General color above black, shot with green and purple; wing-coverts
like the back, the innermost and the scapulars with a slight
subterminal shine of coppery brown; primary-coverts and primaries
black, the secondaries externally green; feathers of the lower back
and rump straw-yellow, with darker longitudinal centers of black or
green; upper tail-coverts and tail glossy oil-green; crown of head
and nape black; hind-neck and neck-hackles, as well as sides of neck,
straw-yellow, deeper on the hind-neck, with green longitudinal centers
to the feathers; remainder of under surface of body black with a
green gloss; comb short and rounded; sides of face and entire throat
bare. Total length 34.5 inches [876 mm.], culmen 1.1 [28], wing 9.0
[229], tail 17.5 [445], tarsus 3.4 [86]."

[6] Birds from some of these localities may be M. langhornei.

[7] It is possible that all the records of Ptilocolpa for Mindanao
should be referred to P. mindanensis.

[8] Whitehead's diagnosis is as follows: "Similis P. griseipectori
(Bp.), sed plaga præpectorali nigra, nec cinerea, facile
distinguenda. Long. tot. 13.0 poll., alæ 8.3, caudæ 4.8, tarsi 0.85."

[9] The order Colymbiformes as used here is equivalent to order VIII
Podicipedidiformes of Sharpe's Hand-List and not order IX Colymbiformes
of that work. Tachybaptus Reichenbach is to be used for the genus
or subgenus Podiceps Latham. Cf. Stone, Auk (1907), 24, 190; Allen,
Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. (1907), 24, 24.

[10] Mr. W. Eagle Clarke informs me that he has received a specimen
of the Philippine grebe from Panay.

[11] As the Bureau of Science collection contains very few specimens
belonging to the order Lariformes and as these are winter specimens
only, the greater part of the specific descriptions of Philippine
gulls and terns are copied from Saunders's excellent work, in volume
25 of the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum.

[12] Cf. Bureau, Bull. Soc. Sci. Nat. Ouest France (1904), 14, 227-256.

[13] While I have examined specimens of nearly all the species in
this order which are known to occur in the Philippine Islands the
material available to me is unsatisfactory as a basis for specific
descriptions. This is due to the fact that most of the species under
consideration are migrants and can be taken in the Philippines in
non-breeding plumage only. Rather than present descriptions based
upon inadequate material I have included here numerous quotations
from Sharpe's monograph of the Limicolæ (Catalogue of Birds in the
British Museum, volume 24) and from other standard works.

[14] The Ticao specimen was listed as Numenius arquata, McGregor and
Worcester, Hand-List, p. 24; it is really a specimen of N. variegatus.

[15] "Ocrophus" is said to be a misprint.

[16] Cf. Allen, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. (1907), 24, 20.

[17] See also footnote under Ixobrychus cinnamomeus, p. 179.

[18] Cf. Allen, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. (1907), 24, 36.

[19] Stejneger, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. Wash. (1887), 10, 289, places
this species in his subgenus Nannocnus and gives the following key:


a1. Tibiæ feathered nearly to the heel-joint; longest tail-feathers
longer than middle toe without claw (Ardetta). ... A. sinensis
a2. Tibiæ naked at the lower end, longest tail-feathers shorter than
middle toe without claw (Nannocnus).

  b1. Quills and tail-feathers blackish. ... A. eurhythma
  b2. Quills and tail-feathers cinnamon-rufous. ... A. cinnamomea



The characters of Nannocnus seem to be, as stated by Stejneger,
of no more than subgeneric value.

[20] All of the species of ducks here enumerated, except Marila marila,
are represented in the Bureau of Science collection by specimens taken
in the Philippine Islands, but with the exception of the abundant
Dendrocygna arcuata these are adults only, in winter plumage. I have
constructed keys and diagnoses from this material but for detailed
descriptions I have depended almost entirely upon Salvadori's monograph
in volume 27 of the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum.

[21] The white-faced tree duck, Dendrocygna viduata (Linnæus), has
been recorded as a Philippine species; I believe it should be omitted
from our list.

[22] Mr. W. Eagle Clarke informs us that he has received a specimen
of this duck from Negros.

[23] The Phæthontidæ have the nostrils open and the interramal
space feathered. No member of this family has been reported from the
Philippine Islands.

[24] Through the interest of Mr. William Edmonds, teacher in the
Batanes, a specimen of the tic-wee buzzard from Batan has been sent to
the Bureau of Science. We are under obligations to Mr. Otto Sheerer for
two live specimens of this species which were caught in Batan. Still
another tic-wee buzzard was captured on board the U. S. S. Albatross
in the vicinity of Camiguin Island, north of Luzon.

[25] The Sibuyan specimen was recorded as Falco peregrinus in
Publ. Govt. Labs. (1905), 25, 11.

[26] Sharpe's diagnosis is as follows: "F. similis F. melanogeni,
sed nigricantior, subtus ubique cinereo adumbratus, et
subalaribus axillaribusque nigris, lineis parvulis albis
transfasciatis. Long. tot. 15.5 poll., alæ 11.6, caudæ 5.5, tarsi 1.9."

[27] "The length of the bill varies considerably, some specimens,
measured from the anterior margin of the cere, being only 30,
others 34."

[28] Sharpe's diagnosis and remarks on this species are as follows:
"S. similis S. umbratili, sed multo minor et omnino saturate brunnea,
modo Scopino vermiculata et notata, sed regione auriculari rufo-brunnea
concolore, et fasciis frontalibus et cervicalibus pallidis obsoletis.

"The above diagnosis well expresses the relations of this dark-colored
Scops owl, which is more dingy in color than any species I know."

[29] Sharpe's diagnosis is as follows: "S. similis S. mantananensis
sed alis extus vix albo notatis, et remigibus intus vix fasciatis
distinguenda. Long. tot. 8.0 poll., alæ 6.0."

[30] "This bird is described as being most probably the same as the
typical Sumatran N. scutulata (Raffl.)."

[31] Sharpe's diagnosis of this species follows: "Similis
N. reyi, sed maculis pallidis primariorum paucis fulvescentibus,
minime albo quadratim notatis, et abdomine, hypochondriis,
et tibiis ochrascentifulvis, nec albis brunneo maculatis
distinguenda. Long. tot. 9.5 poll., alæ 7.7."

[32] "Quant a la Chouette qui provient du meme [Sulu] archipel, on
peut la distinguer immédiatement de l'espèce commune des Philippines
(Ninox philippensis) par sa taille plus forte (o m. 29), par ses
ailes beaucoup plus longues et depassant même l'extrémité de la quene,
et enfin par son plumage roux, rayé transversalement de brun sur la
tete et sur les épaules. Par ce dernier caractère, la chouette des
îles Sooloo, que pourra être appelée Ninox Reyi, ressemble en peu
au Glaucidium ou Athene cuculoides de l'Indo-Chine, espèce dont les
ailes sont, du reste, beaucoup moins developpées." (Oustalet.)

[33] The descriptions given above are from a copy of the original,
the essential part of which follows:

"Ich beschreibe ein altes vollausgafärbtes Weibchen dieser Eule wie
folgt: Oberher rötlichbraun, schwach ins Olive spielend. Oberkopf,
Kopfseiten, Hinterhals, Halsseiten und Mantel heller fahlrötlich schmal
gebändert; auf Unterrücken und Bürzel wird diese Bindenzeichnung
undeutlich, so dass diese Teile nahezu einfärbig erscheinen. Kinn
hell. Kehlfedern hellfahl mit dunklen Schaflstrichen. Brust und Bauch
auf lebhaft rotbraunem Grunde schmal schwärzlich gebändert. Flügelbug
weiss. Skapularen und grosse Flügeldeckfedern mit einigen grösseren
mattweissen Flecken auf der Aussenfahne. Schwingen erster Ordnung:
Innenfahne einfärbig schwärzlich, Aussenfahne mit breiteren
dunkelbraunen und schmaleren rötlichfahlen Bindenflecken. Auf den
Tertiärschwingen erscheinen sehr undeutlich breite, dunklere Binden und
längs des Randes der Aussenfahne hellfahle Fleckenspuren. Schwanzfedern
mit gleichbreiten bräunlichen und dunkleren Binden. Untere
Schwanzdecken hellfahl. Innere Flügeldecken hellbraunrötlich mit
dunklerer Fleckung. Beine hellgelblich. Iris gelb. Ganze Länge circa
250 mm, Flügel 169 mm, Schwanz 80 mm.

"Ein zweites Exemplar gez. [male] unterscheidet sich nur dadurch,
dass die Binden des Unterbauchs und der Hosen auf hellerem Grunde
stehen. Auch auf Brust und Epigastrium ist die rotbraune Grundfarbe
etwas heller. Flügel 168 mm, Schwanz 80 mm.

"Ein drittes Exemplar gez. [female]. Das Braunrot des Abdomen
sehr feurig mit unregelmässiger und weniger deutlicher
Bindenzeichnung. Flügel 168 mm, Schwanz 78 mm.

"Ein viertes Exemplar. Nestjunges Weibchen. Oberher
olivenbräunlich. Nur auf dem Scheitel Bindenzeichnung. Unterher
rotbräunlich mit Spuren von Binden auf der Brust. Die Federn
des Bauches zeigen dunkle Schaftstriche. Untere Schwanzdecken
hellfuchsrötlich. Die dunklen Flecken auf den Aussenfahnen der
grösseren Schwingen stehen auf hellfahlem Grunde.

"Vergleicht man die vorstehende Beschreibung von Ninox Plateni
Blas. mit den Beschreibungen von Ninox spilonotus und Ninox mindorensis
so ist das Ergebniss ein unsicheres, wenig befriedigendes. Der Umstand,
dass in der Beschreibung von Ninox spilonotus nur von Flecken und
an keiner Stelle von Bindenzeichnung die Rede ist, sowie, dass die
Innenfahnen der grösseren Schwingen als 'spotted and barred with light
rufous brown' beschrieben werden, genügt vollkommen, um jeden Gedanken
an Gleichartigkeit von N. Plateni und N. spilonotus auszuschliessen."

[34] Cf. Auk (1908), 25, 371.

[35] The validity of the following species is doubtful:

Prioniturus suluensis W. Blasius; Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 29.
Prioniturus discurus var. suluënsis Blasius, Jour. für Ornith. (1890),
140. Prioniturus suluensis Salvadori, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1891),
20, 419.



Adult.--"Very much like P. discurus, from which it differs in being
larger and in the greater extension of the blue color on the crown,
where it begins from the anterior edge of the forehead and extends
to the occiput; also lores bluish green; on the nape and upper part
of the back there is a very distinct olive patch, of the same color
as the under parts. Length, 343; wing, 163; central tail-feathers,
165; lateral tail-feathers, 76; bill, 23; tarsus, 17." (Salvadori.)

"The Sulu bird (P. suluensis Blasius) has been separated on account
of its larger size and the blue on the crown being more extended,
beginning at the anterior edge of the forehead and extending to the
occiput. Its larger size (wing 165 mm.) one can appreciate, but the
supposed difference in the blue on the crown and other minor characters
mentioned are equally found in birds from Basilan, Mindanao, etc.,
so that P. suluensis can only be considered a rather larger insular
race of P. discurus, which it absolutely resembles in plumage." Grant,
Ibis (1895), 263.

The blue on the crown and forehead seems to be a variable quantity
in Prioniturus discurus and its allies and the status of suluensis
and waterstradti can only be determined when good series from various
localities are studied.

[36] In many specimens otherwise in adult plumage, the cheeks are
green, but this seems to be invaded by extension of blue from the
crown as the birds become older.

[37] The key is that of the Catalogue of Birds with slight changes.

[38] The status of the following is doubtful:

Loriculus sp. Salvadori.


    Loriculus sp. Salvadori, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1891), 20,
    530 (foot note); Sharpe, Hand-List (1900), 2, 36; McGregor and
    Worcester, Hand-List (1906), 50.

    Mindanao (Cuming).


"It is about the size of L. siquijorensis; in coloring it comes
near the female of L. apicalis, but has the red of the crown not
reaching the occiput; the tail above shows much blue towards the
tip of the lateral feathers. I add the description of the specimen,
which is not in very good condition: Green; forehead and vertex red;
nape with a slight tinge of orange; cheeks and throat blue; rump and
upper tail-coverts red; tail green above, the lateral feathers blue
towards the tip; tail underneath deep blue; bill orange. Length, 165;
wing, 98; tail, 44." (Salvadori.)

[39] The description of the male, as given by Dr. Finsch, is as
follows:

"Altes Männchen. Oberseite des Kopfes, Hals und alle unteren Theile
(einschliesslich der unteren Schwanzdecken) rostgelblichweiss;
Wangen und Ohrgegend, von letzterer in einem breiteren Bande um die
nackte Kehle sich herumziehend, braunschwarz; alle oberen Theile
(einschliesslich der oberen Schwanz- und unteren Flugeldecken)
dunkelbraun, mit schwach grünlichem Metallschimmer, der auf
den dunkleren Schwingen deutlicher hervortritt (keine hellen
Schwingensäume); Schwanzfedern schwarzbraun mit grünlichem
Metallschimmer, die zwei mittelsten Federn (etwas unterhalb der
Mitte) mit einer (25 mm.) breiten rostfarbenen Querbinde, die auf der
folgenden nur halb so breit ist, auf der nächstfolgenden nur an der
Innenfahne kleine hellrostfarbene Querflecke, die keine eigentliche
Binde bilden; die zwei äussersten Schwanzfedern jederseits einfarbig
braunschwarz; Schnabel schwarz, etwas rothbraun durchscheinend, der
Aufsatz in ein röthliches Hornbraun übergehend, das gegen die Basis
zu viel heller und etwas durchscheinend ist; auf der Basishälfte des
Oberschnabels machen sich vier schwach vertiefte Furchen bemerkbar,
die von der Mitte bis zum Schneidenrande herablaufen und sich als
senkrechte gelbliche Streifen abheben; Unterschnabel mit drei schief
nach vorn laufenden Längsrillen, von denen die basale röthlichbraun
gefärbt ist; der nackte Augenkreis schmutzig fleischröthlich; die
nackte Basis des Unterschnabels, wie die Nacktheit an Kinn und Kehle,
schmutzig gelblich; Fusse hornschwarz.

"(Im Leben: 'Iris braunroth, Schnabel braunroth mit gelben Streifen
an der Wurzel, Füsse dunkelgrau beinahe schwarz'; Eingeborenen-Name
'Talisi': van der Valk)."

[40] Cf. Oberholser, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington (1906), 19, 68.

[41] The name Salangana Saint-Hilaire, 1837, proposed by
Richmond to replace Collocalia, proves to have been used in a
vernacular sense and therefore is not available. Cf. Oberholser,
Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia (1906), 58, 178.

[42] The late Mr. H. M. Ickis, geologist, Bureau of Science, found
this species breeding in the Island of Polillo and collected nests
and eggs as well as specimens of the bird.

[43] Some authors prefer Apus Scopoli, 1777, for this genus;
Dr. Sharpe uses
Cypselus Illiger, 1811. Cf. Hartert, Das Tierreich (1897), 1, 83;
Sharpe, Hand-List,
(1900), 2, (introduction); Allen, Auk (1901), 18, 121.

[44] The young in several genera are more or less barred and can not
be determined by this key; the females in the genus Eudynamys have
the entire plumage barred and spotted.

[45] The key is modified from that given by Grant, Ibis (1896), 471.

[46] In Sharpe's Hand-List, Calayan is given as one of the localities
for this species, a slip for Catanduanes; no woodpecker is known
from Calayan.

[47] Cf. references to Clarke under Thriponax hargitti.

[48] Cf. Grant, Ibis (1896), 473, under Thriponax mindorensis.

[49] Apart from the characters presented by the tarsal envelope, this
division into suborders is fully justified by internal structures,
but as these can not be examined in skins they are omitted above.

Key to the suborders of Passeriformes based upon internal characters.


a1. Intrinsic muscles of the syrinx fixed to the middle of the
bronchial semirings, the muscles simple, small, and few. ... Mesomyodi
a2. Intrinsic muscles of the syrinx fixed to the ends of the bronchial
semirings, the muscles complex and numerous. ... Acromyodi


[50] The pittas are known to some authors as "ant thrushes" but the
latter name belongs properly to certain members of the South American
family Formicariidæ. The name "ground thrush" appears to have greater
validity as the English name for the Pittidæ, but the use of the name
"thrush" in connection with this family is misleading and unnecessary.

[51] See also the remarks on Pitta propinqua under the next preceding
species.

[52] Cf. Pitta rothschildi, page 420.

[53] Trans. Linn. Soc. 2d. ser. Zool. (1877), 1, 331.

[54] The validity of this species appears to me very doubtful; the
original description follows:

"Völlig abweichend aber präsentiert sich ein anscheinend männliches
stück aus Marinduque (Philippinen), dessen Unterseite derartig stark
mit Blau übertönt erscheint, dass von der grünen Farbe kaum noch
eine Spur sichtbar bleibt. Das Weiss der Flügels in den Schwingen
erscheint bei diesem interessanten Vogel, der zudem stärker ist wie die
beiden anderen Philippiner, in ganz exzessivem Masse entwiekelt; der
Brustfleck dagegen ist relativ klein. Das Kolorit des Steissgefieders
ist in prächtiges Karsisinrot (nicht Zinnoberrot)." (Parrot.)

[55] Some species of the swallow family are known to European authors
as sand martins, while other species are called house martins, but as,
in the United States, the name martin is closely associated with the
genus Progne, I prefer to retain the name swallow for all the species
of Hirundinidæ known from the Philippine Islands.

[56] Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 204, recognizes H. fuliginosa as
distinct from H. sibirica and gives Palawan as one of its localities. A
flycatcher collected by Platen in Palawan is recorded by Blasius as
H. sibirica and I have met with no reference to H. fuliginosa from
that Island except as given by Sharpe.

[57] The islands of Bongao and Sulu are given here on the authority
of Sharpe's Hand-List.

[58] Sharpe, Hand-List, gives the locality "Palawan (winter)" for
this flycatcher; I have not found that it is recorded from Palawan.

[59] See also Whitehead, Ibis (1899), 107.

[60] This key is slightly modified from the one given by Grant, Ibis
(1896), 542.

[61] Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 276, assigns the species
C. nigrorum and C. olivacea to Abrornis. Oates says: "Abrornis
resembles Cryptolopha in everything except the tail, which has ten
feathers instead of twelve." As the species mentioned above have
twelve rectrices I have put them in Cryptolopha.

[62] Cf. footnote under Cryptolopha olivacea, p. 474.

[63] Whitehead's diagnosis is as follows: "Similis C. montis sed
rostro crassiore et uropygio sulphureo destinguenda."

[64] There is some doubt as to the species of Artamides found in
Libagao, but it is in all probability A. mindorensis.

[65] Sharpe's diagnosis reads:

"Mas a mari E. morionis ex insula Celebensi vix diversus. Foem. tamen
gastraeo toto cinereo concolore facile distinguenda." Sharpe should
have compared the male with E. mindanense as well as with E. morio.

[66] This key can be used with adult birds only.

[67] No specimen of L. melanoleuca was collected on Semirara but
"a bird, probably of this species, was seen."

[68] Cf. Sharpe, Hand-List (1901), 3, 309. I find no record of this
Irena having been taken in Balabac.

[69] Mearns gives the following characters for this subspecies:
"Similar to the Luzon guava bulbul (Pycnonotus goiavier goiavier),
but smaller, with relatively shorter tail, broader supraorbital white
stripes, and a paler auricular patch." The comparative measurements
given by Mearns are not convincing and I am not prepared to admit
the validity of this subspecies.

[70] Leonardina (p. 537) probably belongs near Mixornis and Macronous;
I have not seen it.

[71] The original description of Mixornis (=Zosterornis) plateni
follows:

"Mixornis plateni, bedeutend kleiner als M. capitalis, mit welcher
Form die Art, besonders von der Oberseite gesehen, eine gewisse
Aehnlichkeit in der Färbung besitzt.

"Oberseite olivenbraun, Bürzel und Schwanzdeckfedern mehr
rostfarben, am Vorderrücken weisse Schaftstriche. Ganzer Kopf, oben
und an den Seiten, Nacken und Brust rothbraun mit feinen weissen
Schaftstrichen. Kinn und Kehle mehr schwärzlich mit breiteren weissen
Schaftflecken. Schwanzfedern einfarbig braun, an der Aussenfahne
olivenfarben verwaschen. Ebenso die schwanz federn oberseits und die
oberen Flügeldeckfedern. Untere Flügeldeckfedern und Achselfedern
weisslich. Masse: [female] Long. tot. 12 cm. Ala 5.5 cm. Caud. 4.7
cm. Culmen 1.0 cm. Tarsus 1.5 cm. Type: Museum Brunsvicense."

[72] The original description of Macronous kettlewelli follows:
"Brunneus; dorsi plumis filiformibus, elongatis, versus basin
nigricantibus; rachide, et partibus plumæ rachidi adjacentibus,
albidis; alis fulvescenti-brunneis, exterius pallidioribus;
supracaudalibus caudaque pallide castaneis; pileo dorso concolori,
rachidibus plumarum albidis; fronte nigricante, magis distincte
striata; superciliis, loris et regione parotica nigricantibus,
albo lineatis; genis et corpore toto subtus pallide cervinis;
hypochondriis brunnescentibus; gula summa et abdomine medio
albicantibus; gutture et corporis lateribus vix albido lineatis;
subalaribus pectori concoloribus; iride smaragdinea; rostro et pedibus
brunneis. Long. tot. circa 0.140 m; al. 0.063 m; caud. 0.070 m;
rostr. 0.015 m; tars. 0.024 m." (Guillemard.)

[73] For detailed characters of the Turdidæ the reader is referred to
Seebohm, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. (1881), 5, 2; and to Birds of North
and Middle America, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus. Washington (1907), 50,
pt. 4, 1 to 4.

[74] This key to the Philippine species of Planesticus is taken from
a paper by Mearns, Phil. Journ. Sci. (1907), 2, sec. A, 359.

[75] Birds of the genus Planesticus are called "blackbirds" in Europe
and "robins" in the United States; as both of these names are in common
use for birds of entirely different genera I have employed the name
"black thrush" for the Philippine species of Planesticus.

[76] I use Forster's name for this rock thrush on the recommendation
of Dr. C. W. Richmond.

[77] Cf. Grant, Ibis (1896), 117.

[78] I follow Sharpe in alloting Lanius validirostris and L. nasutus to
Cephalophoneus. The type of this genus is said to be Lanius bucephalus,
a species resembling Lanius validirostris in length of tail and
turgidity of bill. These two species appear to be congeneric. In
L. nasutus, however, the tail is much longer; the rectrices are more
strongly graduated and relatively narrower. Possibly another genus
should be recognized for nasutus and suluensis.

[79] Philippine specimens of this genus have usually been referred to
Lanius (Otomela) lucionensis, but both O. cristata and O. superciliosa
are credited to the Philippines in Sharpe's Hand-List and for this
reason they are included here. Having no specimens of undoubted
identity I am unable to determine many of the specimens of shrikes in
the Bureau of Science collection. Of the last two species mentioned
I give the distribution and short descriptions on the authority
of Dresser.

The following paragraphs may be of use in distinguishing the three
species.

"L. superciliosus Latham * * * has the entire upper surface very bright
uniform rufous, a very broad frontal band, a very broad superciliary
stripe, and the throat pure white; the inner webs of the basal parts
of the primaries white underneath, which shows through on the upper
surface of the quills at their insertion, almost forming a white,
yet concealed alar bar; shoulder-edge and under shoulder-coverts
pure white.

"L. cristatus Linnæus has the head, nape, rump, upper tail-coverts, and
tail rufous, but less bright and browner than in L. superciliosus. The
back is colored with the same tint, but paler or less rufous. The
chin and upper part of the throat are white; but the tawny hue of
the breast extends higher up than in either L. superciliosus or in
L. lucionensis; and all the throat is usually washed with tawny.

"The white frontal band is narrow and ill-defined; and the white
supercilium is much less prominent than in L. superciliosus. The
quills at their insertions show indications, although slight, of a
rudimentary alar bar. The shoulder-edge and under shoulder-coverts
are tawny. The female is colored as the male, but has the subocular
stripe brown and not black and the sides of the breast and flanks
more or less striated and freckled with faint brown marks.

"L. lucionensis Linnæus has the forehead and crown delicate pale
pearl-gray, no pure white whatever on the forehead. A narrow white
supercilium commences above the eye, becoming somewhat broader behind,
and shading off into the gray of the head. The occiput, nape, and
back are ashy liver-brown. The rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail are
washed with rufous, most marked on the upper tail-coverts; the chin
and throat pure white, as in L. superciliosus; shoulder-edge and under
shoulder-coverts pure white; indications of a concealed white alar
bar, as in L. cristatus; and the female has the sexual distinguishing
characters of that species. The almost entire absence of rufous in
the plumage of the adult Philippine species suffices to distinguish
it at a glance from L. cristatus and L. superciliosus." Walden,
Trans. Zool. Soc. (1875), 9, 171, 172.

[80] "Adult male.--Similar to typical Hyloterpe apoensis, but paler
throughout, with crown brownish instead of grayish; under parts
canary-yellow instead of lemon-yellow; slightly smaller. Wing, 78;
tail, 67; culmen, 14; bill from nostril, 9.2; tarsus, 17.5. 'Iris
brown. Bill black.'

"Adult female * * *.--Paler and dingier than the male; under parts pale
canary-yellow from throat backward. Wing, 71; tail, 61; tarsus, 17.5.

"Remarks.--Specimens in the U. S. National Museum, collected on
the Island of Siquijor, Philippine Islands, by F. S. Bourns and
D. C. Worcester, are exactly like Basilan specimens taken in February,
1888, and must be included as belonging to this species. Lowland
birds from Mindanao Island connect the forms apoensis and
basilanica." (Mearns.)

Specimens from Siquijor, although larger than true H. apoensis,
seem to be nearly like this species in color.

[81] The titmouse of Sulu and Tawi Tawi is probably not true Parus
elegans.

[82] The construction of a key to the species of silvereyes is rendered
very difficult by the nature of the characters upon which a number
of the species are based. Some of the species can be determined only
by the actual comparison of specimens in fresh plumage. Immediately
following the molt, the colors are bright and yellowish, but after
a few months the feathers become much abraded and the colors become
duller, dingier and greener.

[83] The identity of Porter's Caluya specimen with Zosterops aureiloris
is somewhat doubtful.

[84] Gould's type came from "Manila," its collector is unknown
and Dicæum retrocinctum has not been found in Luzon by any recent
collector. It seems probable that the type was not collected in Luzon.

[85] Steere did not record this species from Marinduque, but in
Bourns and Worcester's MS. notes I find the remark: "Doubtless
also Marinduque." Cf. also Worcester and Bourns, Distribution List,
Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. Washington (1898), 20, 560, no. 361.

[86] Sharpe's original diagnosis of Dicæum sibutuense is as follows:
"D. simile, D. trigonostigmati, sed gutture saturate schistaceo,
macula dorsale aurantiaca distinguendum. Long. tot. 3.2 poll.,
culm. 0.45, alæ 2.0, caudæ 0.85, tarsi 0.5."

[87] The original diagnosis and description of Dicæum flaviventer,
from which the above description is taken, are as follows:

"Dicæum D. rubriventri Less. similis, sed parte media pectoris
abdominisque cadmiumino-flava, capite supra dorsoque virescentibus
et uropygio obscure ardesiaco distinguendum.

"Long. al. 55, caud. 30, tars. 12, culm. 10.5 mm. ([male]).

"Hab. Insula Philippinarum Cebú.

"Kopf, Oberrücken und Flügeldecken grünlich schwarz mit etwas

aschgrau, in der Mitte desselben ein schöner cadmiumgelber, bis 6 mm
breiter Streif (Ridgway: cadmium-yellow Pl. VI, 6), nach dem After
zu in Weiss übergehend; untere Schwanzdecken, Axillaren und untere
Flügeldecken weiss, die äusseren mit einem schwärzlichen Fleck in
der Mitte. Hosen aussen weiss, hinten terminal schwärzlich. Füsse
braun. Schnabel schwarz, kräftig."

[88] Celestino's specimens were recorded by mistake as Dicæum papuense,
Phil. Jour. Sci. (1906), 1, 907.

[89] I have not seen the females of C. guimarasensis and C. flagrans.

[90] "Characters.--Most closely resembling Cyrtostomus jugularis
jugularis of Luzon, but slightly larger, with the upper parts
olive-green instead of brownish olive-gray; under parts nearly uniform
lemon-yellow instead of canary-yellow." (Mearns.)

[91] "Characters.--Smaller than Cyrtostomus jugularis aurora,
C. jugularis jugularis, or C. jugularis dinagatensis, old males
differing from all three in the metallic reflections on the middle
of the dark metallic plastron, which are bluish and violet instead
of green-blue; under parts shading very gradually from rich orange,
adjoining the dark metallic plastron, to clear yellow on the crissum
and under tail-coverts; back a more golden olive-green than in the
other Philippine forms; forehead, lores, and superciliary stripe
solid metallic violet purple." (Mearns.)

[92] Hartert's remarks on Anthreptes malaccensis wiglesworthi are
as follows: "Kopfseiten fast so roth wie bei rhodolaema, Unterseite
wie bei chlorigaster (siehe oben). (Meinem zu früh verstorbenen
ornithologischen Freunde Wiglesworth gewidmet, der mit A. B. Meyer
zusammen in den 'Birds of Celebes' interessante Notizen über diese
Gruppe gab.) Sulu Inseln. Typus Tring Museum, Sulu I. v. '83, Powell
coll. Alle Stücke von den Sulu Inseln, die ich sah, sind ohne Zweifel
zur gleichen Form zu rechnen."

[93] Philippine specimens of this genus may be the recently described
Budytes flavus alascensis but no specimens of that race are available
for comparison. Cf. Ridgway, Bds. North and Middle America (1904),
3, 8 and 10.

[94] Cf. Richmond, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. Washington (1903), 26, 504.

[95] In the Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum this
species falls under "a. With the hind claw decidedly shorter than the
hallux." but in the figures of the foot in the Catalogue and in the
Fauna of British India the claw is decidedly longer than the hallux,
and Sharpe (p. 565) says: "Hind claw long and straight, a trifle
shorter than hind toe, but sometimes longer."

[96] Coues describes this, the most important character of the family,
in the following words: "But the most tangible characteristic of the
family [Fringillidæ] is angulation of the commissure. The commissure
runs in a straight line, or with a slight curve, to or near to the base
of the bill, and is then more or less abruptly bent down at a varying
angle--the cutting edge of the upper mandible forming a reëntrance,
that of the lower mandible a corresponding salience. In familiar terms,
we might say that the corners of the mouth are drawn down--that the
finches, though very merry little birds, are literally 'down in the
mouth.' In the great majority of cases this feature is unmistakable,
and in the grosbeaks, for example, it is very strongly marked indeed;
but in some of the smaller-billed forms, and especially those with
slender bills, it is hardly perceptible."

[97] This species is called "tree sparrow" by some authors.

[98] Chlorura Reichenbach, 1863, is preoccupied by Chlorura Sclater,
1862.

[99] Grant's diagnosis of Chlorura brunneiventris follows:
"C. similis C. borneensi, Sharpe, sed abdomine quoque rufescente,
pectore concolore; pectoris lateribus caeruleo lavatis; fronte caerulea
laetiore et minus extensa. Long. tot. 4.2 poll., alae 2.3."

[100] "Characters.--Slightly larger than Dicrurus balicassius from
Luzon Island; also differing in having the metallic reflections of
the upper parts and breast greenish blue instead of bluish green.

"Measurements of type (adult male).--Wing, 148; tail, 130; culmen,
27; tarsus, 25." (Mearns.)

[101] Wrongly given as "Mindanao" in McGregor and Worcester's
Hand-List, p. 107.

[102] This recently published description is based upon one specimen
and the species is compared with neither Chibia borneensis nor
C. pectoralis. Mearns's description follows:

"Characters.--Very similar to Chibia palawanensis, differing only in
its somewhat larger size, shallower forking of the tail, the narrower
and very much smaller spangles on the breast, and in the absence of
metallic green on the upper tail-coverts.

"Measurements of skin (type and only specimen).--Length, 260; wing,
136; tail, 126; emargination of tail, 16; culmen (chord), 28.5;
tarsus, 24.5." (Mearns.)

[103] The description of Chibia borneensis follows: "C. similis
C. pectorali ex insulis Sulaensibus, sed plumis lanceolatis colli
lateralis metallice chalybeo-viridibus nec purpurascentibus, et
maculis jugularibus et praepectoralibus valde minoribus et conspicue
metallicis chalybeo-viridibus distinguenda. Long. tot. 10, culm. 1.3,
alae 5.9, caudae, 4.5, tarsi 0.85." (Sharpe.)

[104] The name myna is restricted by Jerdon, and other writers on
Indian ornithology, to the species of Acridotheres and Temenuchus,
while the species of Eulabes are called hill mynas. Mina, maina,
and minor are merely variants of myna.

[105] The status of "Sarcops lowii" is doubtful; the description
follows: "This species appears to be distinguished from the ordinary
Sarcops calvus by its gray mantle, which resembles the rest of the
back, and by the color of the under surface, which is silvery gray
with a narrow blackish line down the center of the body, whereas in
S. calvus the mantle is black, and the under surface also, only the
flanks being gray." (Sharpe.)

[106] See note under crested myna.

[107] The Philippine crow is given in Table II of Everett's paper on
the birds of Palawan, Proc. Zool. Soc. (1889), 225, and this record is
repeated in McGregor and Worcester's Hand-List (1906), 110, but there
appears to be no other evidence of the occurrence of the Philippine
crow in Palawan.
